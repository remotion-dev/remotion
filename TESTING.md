# Testing

For general information concerning contribution, please consult [CONTRIBUTION.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Running tests

There are tests in each package as well as end-to-end tests in the root of the monorepo. Run `npm test` in a package, or in the root to run all tests. Run `pnpm exec jest` to only run unit tests and skip linting.
