This is a Next.js template for building programmatic video apps with [`@remotion/player`](https://remotion.dev/player) and rendering via [Vercel Sandbox](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/sandbox).

This template uses the Next.js App directory with TailwindCSS. The rendering happens in a Vercel Sandbox environment, making it easy to deploy and scale on Vercel.
