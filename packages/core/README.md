Remotion is a suite of libraries building a fundament for **creating videos programmatically using React.**

## Why create videos in React?

- **Leverage web technologies**: Use all of CSS, Canvas, SVG, WebGL, etc.
- **Leverage programming**: Use variables, functions, APIs, math and algorithms to create new effects
- **Leverage React**: Reusable components, Powerful composition, Fast Refresh, Package ecosystem
