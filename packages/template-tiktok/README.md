Welcome to your Remotion project!

## Commands

**Install Dependencies**

```console
npm i
```

**Start Preview**

```console
npm run dev
```

**Render video**

```console
npx remotion render
```

**Upgrade Remotion**

```console
npx remotion upgrade
```

## Captioning

Replace the `sample-video.mp4` with your video file.
Caption all the videos in you `public` by running the following command:

```console
node sub.mjs
```

Only caption a specific video:

```console
node sub.mjs <path-to-video-file>
```

Only caption a specific folder:

```console
node sub.mjs <path-to-folder>
```

## Configure Whisper.cpp

Captioning will download Whisper.cpp and the 1.5GB big `medium.en` model. To configure which model is being used, you can configure the variables in `whisper-config.mjs`.

### Non-English languages

To support non-English languages, you need to change the `WHISPER_MODEL` variable in `whisper-config.mjs` to a model that does not have a `.en` sufix.

## Rendering on Lambda

If you plan on deploying this template to Lambda, make sure to enable the [`--enable-v5-runtime`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/cli/functions#--enable-v5-runtime) flag.  
This will enable a Chrome version which supports the `paint-order` CSS property that is required for this template to render properly.
