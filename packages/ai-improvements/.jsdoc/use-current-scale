/**
 * @description Retrieves the current scale of the canvas within Remotion's Studio or Player context. In the Studio, it corresponds to the zoom level (1 equals no scaling, i.e., 100% zoom). In the Player, it indicates the scaling necessary to fit the video into the player. If called outside of a Remotion context, by default, it throws an error unless configured not to.
 * @see [Documentation](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/use-current-scale)
