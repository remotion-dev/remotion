Using this template you can create high quality AI videos for TikTok or Instagram.

It includes a simple CLI that will generate story script, images and voiceover using OpenAI and ElevenLabs.

## Getting started with demo video

**Install Dependencies**

```console
bun install
```

**Start Preview**

```console
bun dev
```

## Creating your own videos

You can easily create your own videos using provided CLI.

It will generate a script, images, voiceover and timeline based on your story title and topic. (topic can be e.g. history, eli5, fun facts, science, etc)

**Configure environment variables**

Create .env file with following env vars (you can also find them in .env.example):

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=
```

If you do not create env file - you will be prompted for these variables when using CLI.

**Generate srory timeline**

```console
bun gen
```

You will be prompted API keys (if you haven't added them to .env file), story title and topic.

After that CLI will generate text, images and audio with timestamps, and combine all those into a timeline that van be used by this template to render a video.

## Technical overview

Remotion is rendering videos based on Timeline (timeline.json in project folder). This timeline is generated by CLI.

It consists of three blocks - Elements, Text and Audio.

Elements define slide backgrounds and include enter/exit transitions (e.g. blur) and animations that are applied while slide is active (e.g. scale, rotate).

Text and audio are self explanatory. The only special thing about them is that they are synced.

You can customize the generation of the timeline in **createTimeLineFromStoryWithDetails()** function.

## Deploying on a remove server

Current project nees light modification if you want to deploy it as a remote service.

Remotion renderer with template bundle shuold be deployed as per usual.

Then you have to update Root.tsx to use timeline url that you will pass as a prop (instead of project name).

The last thing - you have to upload generated resources (images and audio) to server and use urls to them instead of file names when generating a timeline.

## Optimisations

You can significantly speed up the story generation by generating audio and images in parallel.
