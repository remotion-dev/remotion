This release brings support for GIF as an output format, official support for Tailwind and makes springs and sequences easier! Plus we recap the best features from v3.0.1 until v3.0.31! ðŸŽ‰

## Render as GIF

[To render a GIF instead of a video](/docs/render-as-gif), pass the `--codec=gif` flag during a render. We tweaked Remotion's rendering process to adapt for the speciality that are GIFs:

- Commonly, a GIF has a framerate in the range of 10-15, and so that you don't have to refactor your video, you can use the [`--every-nth-frame`](/docs/cli/render#--every-nth-frame) flag.

- GIFs are loopable - using the [`--number-of-gif-loops`](/docs/cli/render#--number-of-gif-loops) flag you have control over the GIFs looping behavior!

- You can even render your GIF distributed across many small VMs using Remotion Lambda!

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <em>
    You can put <a href="/docs/gif">{'<Gif>'}</a>'s in your GIF!
  </em>
</p>

## TailwindCSS support

After being broken for a while, [TailwindCSS support](/docs/tailwind) is now stable, and we even made a starter template for it! To get started, [visit our homepage](https://remotion.dev), generate a [GitHub repo from a template](https://github.com/remotion-dev/template-tailwind), try it out [online via StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/remotion-dev/template-tailwind), or type the following into your terminal:

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{ label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
{ label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
{ label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npx create-video --tailwind
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm create video --tailwind
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn create video --tailwind
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

<img style={{width: '100%'}} src="/img/tailwind.gif" />

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <em>Yes, you can write a GIF in Tailwind now.</em>
</p>

## Springs with durations

You can now do this:

```tsx twoslash
import {spring} from 'remotion';
const frame = 10;
// ---cut---
const fps = 30;

const value = spring({
  fps,
  frame,
  config: {
    damping: 200,
  },
  durationInFrames: 300,
});
```

The result will be a spring animation that will take 10 seconds!

Why is this such a game changer? Normally, a spring animation curve is not defined by timing, but by physical parameters. It complicates planning quite a bit, as the duration of a spring is not well-defined. Theoretically, a spring animation is never finished, it keeps on going forever (even though after some time the movement is barely noticeable).

We introduced [measureSpring()](/docs/measure-spring) a while ago which allows you to calculate the duration of a spring by allowing you to set a threshold.

But to change the duration of a spring, you had to change the physics parameters which then in turn change the animation curve!

Until now - if you pass a duration to a spring, we will detect the trajectory of the curve and stretch it so it fits your duration.

## `<OffthreadVideo>` component

[This component](/docs/offthreadvideo) is an alternative to the [`<Video>`](/docs/video) component that extracts frames using FFMPEG and renders them inside an [`<Img>`](/docs/img) tag.

We made the `<OffthreadVideo>` component in order to counteract problems with seeking and throttling that users were reporting with the `<Video>` tag. The new way improves reliability but has it's tradeoffs - read [`<OffthreadVideo> vs <Video>`](/docs/video-vs-offthreadvideo) or check out our [visual explanation on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CftaiHpMM-L/)!

## `renderMedia()` returns a buffer

Previously you could only save your video to a file when using the [`renderMedia()`](/docs/renderer/render-media) and [`stitchFramesToVideo()`](/docs/renderer/stitch-frames-to-video) APIs. Now it can also return a Node.JS [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html)!

## `@remotion/preload` package

This [new package](/docs/preload) offers three APIs that are handy for preloading assets
before they appear in the [`<Player>`](/docs/player): [`resolveRedirect()`](/docs/preload/resolve-redirect), [`preloadAudio()`](/docs/preload/preload-audio) and [`preloadVideo()`](/docs/preload/preload-video).

## Sidebar improvements

If your screen real estate is tight, you may also hide the left sidebar now!

<video playsInline src="/img/sidebar.mp4" autoPlay muted loop />

## Built-in color picker

In the preview, go to `Tools` -> `Color picker` to trigger an eye dropper that allows you to pick any color from the screen! Only Chrome has this feature enabled for now.

## For power users

- Previously you could not wrap your `<Composition>`'s in a React context (e.g. Redux), but this is supported now!
- If you add `--log=verbose` to a Lambda render, you'll see which frames took the longest to render.
- If you provide a file for `--props` during the preview, it will now reload the preview if the props have changed.
- Pressing <kbd>A</kbd> in the preview goes to the beginning of the video, pressing <kbd>E</kbd> goes to the end.
- Pressing play in the preview, then pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> pauses the video and goes back to the point where the video started playing.
- `<Sequence>`'s can now have a `style` prop if the `layout="none"` is not set!
- You can [customize the binaries for Remotion Lambda renders](/docs/lambda/custom-layers), for example to switch out the Emoji font used.
- The `registerRoot()` call can now be deferred using `delayRender()`, so asynchronous loading tasks can be completed first.

## Behind the scenes

We welcome Patric as our intern! As you can see on our [new team page](/about), we are now a team of three and are in the preparations of our first fundraising round.

Remotion won the "Most Exciting use of Technology Award" at React Summit - we owe it all to you!

Going forward, we want to make Remotion even easier to use through new tools, templates and tips!

And wouldn't it be nice if Remotion was faster - I'm exploring multiple options from an alternative concurrency model to a C++ based rendering solution - stay tuned for what's about to come ðŸš€
