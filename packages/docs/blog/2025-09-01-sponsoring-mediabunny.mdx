<Bunny />

With WebCodecs, we get an exciting new API for the browser, allowing us to bring performant multimedia workflows to the web.

There have been 2 serious efforts to create the "FFmpeg for the web", both released in 2025:

- [`@remotion/media-parser`](/docs/media-parser) and [`@remotion/webcodecs`](/docs/webcodecs) (our libraries)
- [Mediabunny](https://mediabunny.dev) (created by [Vanilagy](https://github.com/vanilagy))

Both have their strengths, but we acknowledge Mediabunny is the more promising project:

- Faster than Media Parser
- Better architecture
- Permissive license (MPL-2.0)

Instead of trying to compete, we have decided to team up and push our vision even harder, together!

We're going to **phase out Remotion Media Parser and Remotion WebCodecs and help Mediabunny become the go-to multimedia toolkit for the web**.

This comes in 3 forms:

- Financial: Remotion is now sponsoring Mediabunny with $1000/month.
- Technical: We're going to contribute code, tests and our learnings from building Media Parser.
- Promotional: We're endorsing and supporting Mediabunny's success with all our means.

**TL;DR: We're working together, not against each other, to create the best multimedia toolkit for the web we can - and it's truly open source!** 🐰

### How this benefits Remotion

With access to lower-level multimedia APIs in the browser, we can make more capable and faster video applications!

One of the first unlocks will be a faster, better `<Video/>` tag.  
Later on, Mediabunny will be a big puzzle piece for [enabling rendering videos in the browser](/docs/miscellaneous/render-in-browser).  
APIs like [`extractFrames()`](/docs/webcodecs/extract-frames) and [`getPartialAudioData()`](/docs/webcodecs/get-partial-audio-data) will be converted to use Mediabunny.

### Should I stop using Media Parser?

:::note
As of February 1st 2026, Media Parser is now deprecated!  
We recommend migrating to Mediabunny.
:::

For new projects, we recommend that you [try out Mediabunny](https://mediabunny.dev/guide/quick-start).

You can continue to use Media Parser in existing projects. Media Parser is not yet deprecated.  
We have not yet published any material for how to migrate from Media Parser to Mediabunny, but we will slowly create it and update our documentation.

[See in detail: Differences between Media Parser and Mediabunny](/docs/mediabunny)

### What can I do with a multimedia library in the browser?

Our vision remains the same: Unlocking new functionality for web developers!  
Here is our map for when we launched Remotion Media Parser:

<img src="/img/webcodecs-use-cases.png" alt="WebCodecs use cases" />

Many of these use cases, Mediabunny can already do, [like playing videos without `<video>`](https://mediabunny.dev/examples/media-player/) or [compressing videos](https://mediabunny.dev/examples/file-compression/)!

### What happens with remotion.dev/convert?

It's not yet clear, but we both want to have a video conversion website that works fully offline, uses hardware acceleration and has no ads.

Stay tuned!

### How can I support Mediabunny?

Give [Mediabunny a star on GitHub](https://github.com/vanilagy/mediabunny)!  
If you love the mission, join us in [sponsoring Vanilagy](https://github.com/sponsors/vanilagy) or [contributing code](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny#implementation--development).
