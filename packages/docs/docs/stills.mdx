Remotion is a great solution for rendering thumbnails of videos or dynamic still images too. See our [Still template](https://github.com/remotion-dev/template-still) for an easy way to get started.

If you already have a Remotion project, read on how you can render stills.

## Defining a still

Use the [`<Still />`](/docs/still) component instead of the [`<Composition />`](/docs/composition) one to define a still. The timeline will disappear, and you will not have to define a duration or FPS value.

## Previewing a still in the browser

You can use the [`<Thumbnail>`](/docs/player/thumbnail) component from `@remotion/player` to preview a still image in a regular React app (Next.js, Vite, Create React App, etc.). This is useful if you want to display your still in a web application before rendering it.

## Rendering via CLI

You can use the [`npx remotion still`](/docs/cli/still) command to render a still image. Example command:

```bash
npx remotion still --props='{"custom": "data"}' my-comp out.png
```

You can use the `--image-format` flag to determine the output format. The default format is `png`, with `jpeg`, `webp` and `pdf` being the other options.

By default the frame with number of a composition is being rendered, you can control it using the `--frame` flag.

## Rendering using Node.JS

You can use the [`renderStill()`](/docs/renderer/render-still) Node.JS API to render a still frame programmatically.

## Rendering in the browser

:::warning
Very experimental feature - expect bugs and breaking changes at any time.  
[Track progress on GitHub](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/issues/5913) and discuss in the [`#web-renderer`](https://remotion.dev/discord) channel on Discord.
:::

You can use the [`renderStillOnWeb()`](/docs/web-renderer/render-still-on-web) browser API to render a still frame programmatically.

## Rendering using Remotion Lambda

You can use [Remotion Lambda](/docs/lambda) to render stills:

- Via the [`renderStillOnLambda()`](/docs/lambda/renderstillonlambda) API.
- Via the [`npx remotion lambda still`](/docs/lambda/cli/still) CLI command.

## Rendering using Cloud Run

You can use [Cloud Run](/docs/cloudrun) to render stills:

- Via the [`renderStillOnCloudRun()`](/docs/cloudrun/renderstilloncloudrun) API.
- Via the [`npx remotion cloudrun still`](/docs/cloudrun/cli/still) CLI command.
