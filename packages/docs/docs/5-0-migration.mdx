:::note
Remotion 5.0 is not yet released. This is an incomplete list of breaking changes that are planned for the release.
:::

## How to upgrade

See the [changelog](https://remotion.dev/changelog) to find the latest version.
Upgrade `remotion` and all packages starting with `@remotion` to the latest version, e.g. `5.0.0`:

```diff
- "remotion": "4.0.141"
- "@remotion/bundler": "4.0.141"
- "@remotion/eslint-config": "4.0.141"
- "@remotion/eslint-plugin": "4.0.141"
- "@remotion/cli": "4.0.141"
- "@remotion/renderer": "4.0.141"
+ "remotion": "5.0.0"
+ "@remotion/bundler": "5.0.0"
+ "@remotion/eslint-config": "5.0.0"
+ "@remotion/eslint-plugin": "5.0.0"
+ "@remotion/cli": "5.0.0"
+ "@remotion/renderer": "5.0.0"
```

Run `npm i `, `yarn`, `pnpm i` or `bun i` respectively afterwards.

## Runtime requirements

The minimum Node version is now 18.0.0. The minimum Bun version is 1.1.3.

## `selectComposition()` and `getCompositions()` now require `inputProps`

`inputProps` is now required in [`selectComposition()`](/docs/renderer/select-composition) and [`getCompositions()`](/docs/renderer/get-compositions).  
A common footgun was the render was not working as intended because the input props were not passed.

**Required action**: Pass an empty object `{}` if you don't have any input props.

## `visualizeAudio()` yields different result

[`optimizeFor: "speed"`](/docs/visualize-audio#optimizefor) is now the default. This will yield slightly different results.

**Required action**: Review the visualization of your audio. If unsatisfactory, revert to the old behavior by setting `optimizeFor: "accuracy"`.

## TransitionSeries does not support `layout="none"` anymore

Having a [TransitionSeries](/docs/transitions/transitionseries) with `layout="none"` is not supported anymore.  
It never made sense to have this prop as transitioned elements need to be positioned absolutely.

**Required action**: Remove the `layout` prop.

## Zod should be upgraded to 3.23.8

Remotion previously used the types of Zod 3.22.3. With Remotion 5.0, the types of 3.23.8 are used.

**Required action**: If you use Zod, Upgrade Zod to 3.23.8.

## `measureSpring()` does not accept `from` and `to` options anymore

The values passed in there did not influence the calculation at all. Therefore we removed those options.

**Required action**: Remove the `from` and `to` options from your code.

## `overwrite` is now `true` by default in `renderMediaOnLambda()`

The default value of `overwrite` has been changed to `true` in `renderMediaOnLambda()`. This skips a check that the file already exists in the S3 bucket, which makes the render start faster.

**Required action**: If you want to keep the old behavior, set `overwrite: false`, explicitly.

## `openBrowser()` now takes a `logLevel` instead of `shouldDumpIo`

The `shouldDumpIo` option has been be removed in 5.0.  
Use `logLevel: "verbose"` instead.

## `diskSizeInMb` is now 10240 by default

For Remotion Lambda, the default disk size is now 10240 MB.  
This will add a miniscule cost to your renders technically, but will lead to more reliable and faster renders, since Chrome is less likely to run out of disk cache.

**Required actions**:

- If you want to keep the old behavior, set `diskSizeInMb: 2048`, explicitly.
- If your Lambda function name is hardcoded to include `disk2048mb`, unhardcode it and use `speculateFunctionName()` to get the correct name.

## Some APIs should be imported from `@remotion/lambda/client`

`renderMediaOnLambda()`, `getRenderProgress()`, `renderStillOnLambda()`, `presignUrl()`, `getSites()` have been removed from `@remotion/lambda`.  
They are now available in `@remotion/lambda/client`.

## `@remotion/google-fonts` requires specifying weights and subsets

When using `loadFonts()` from `@remotion/google-fonts`, you must now specify which font weights and subsets you want to load. Loading all weights and subsets by default is no longer supported as it can lead to timeouts.

**Required action**: Explicitly specify the weights and subsets you need:

```ts
import {loadFont} from '@remotion/google-fonts/Roboto';

loadFont('normal', {
  weights: ['400', '700'],
  subsets: ['latin'],
});
```

## License changes

Remotion 5.0 has an updated license. View the [license](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/blob/5-0-license/LICENSE.md) here or compare the [changes](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/pull/3750).

There are two effective changes in this license:

- **Contractors now also count towards team size.** Previously, a company could work exclusively with contractors and never have to get a company license.
- **For customers, the license is now tied to our updated [terms and conditions](https://www.remotion.pro/terms)**.  
  Previously, our terms were generated by a Terms and conditions generator and did not make sense.  
  We updated them to make sense in the context of Remotion.
