Support for React Native is currently not planned due to performance issues.  
While we previously prototyped this, the main culprit is the model of re-rendering on every frame, which prevents achieving the high performance levels that are possible on the web.

Ideally, a framework for making videos in React Native would integrate with one of the animation solutions like Reanimated.  
Significant architectural changes would be required to support frameworks like Remotion within React Native effectively.

For this reason, we are not pursuing a React Native integration at the moment.

## App.js Experiment

At App.js, we previously shown an experimental renderer for Remotion.  
We have not gained enough interest to pursue it further.

## Expo DOM Components Experiment

An experiment with Expo DOM components is available [here](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-dom-components-canary-example/pull/4).
