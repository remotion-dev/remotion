# Timeline FAQ

## Will the template work with React 18?

Yes, the template is fully compatible with React 18. We've intentionally avoided using React 19-specific features like the `use()` hook or the new direct component ref-passing to ensure backward compatibility. This means you can confidently use this template with React 18 projects without encountering compatibility issues.

If you do experience any problems or unexpected behavior while using the template with React 18, please create an issue in the repository.

## Does the template include state management libraries?

No, we use React Context for basic state management instead of third-party libraries like Zustand or Redux.

This decision wasn't about maintaining "purity" - it's about practicality. State management libraries often require specific architectural approaches and can become outdated or limit flexibility. By sticking with React Context, we provide a foundation that works well for most use cases while remaining adaptable.

If your project needs more sophisticated state management for performance optimization, you can easily add the library that best fits your specific requirements. Whether that's Zustand for its simplicity, Redux for complex state, or something else entirely - the choice is yours and can be tailored to your particular application needs.

Our goal is to provide a template that works well for everyone without imposing unnecessary opinion or complexity on your project.
