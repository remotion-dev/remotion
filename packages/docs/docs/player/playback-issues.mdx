Read this page if you encounter issues with media playback in the Player such as:

- Black frames inbetween scenes
- Audio choppiness
- Unexpected pausing
- Jumping around

## Ensure best practices

<div>
<Step>1</Step> <span>Add <a href="/docs/player/buffer-state">`pauseWhenBuffering`</a> to `<Audio>`, `<Video>`, `<OffthreadVideo>` and `<Img>` components.</span>
</div>
<div>
<Step>2</Step> <span>For seamless transitions, use the <a href="/docs/player/premounting">`premountFor`</a> prop for `<Sequence>`'s.</span>
</div>
<div>
<Step>3</Step> <span>Don't use <a href="/docs/prefetch">`prefetch()`</a> if the Player is already mounted.</span>
</div>
<div>
<Step>4</Step> <span>Avoid over-aggressive `prefetch()`-ing and premounting - it will use up resources faster.</span>
</div>

## Enable logging<AvailableFrom v="4.0.250"/>

You can observe mounting, loading, seeking and buffering events of media by adding `logLevel="trace"` to the `<Player>` component.

```tsx twoslash title='Adding logLevel="trace" to the Player'
const otherProps = {
  compositionHeight: 1080,
  compositionWidth: 1920,
  inputProps: {},
  component: () => null,
  fps: 30,
  durationInFrames: 100,
};

// ---cut---
import React from 'react';
import {Player} from '@remotion/player';

export const MyApp: React.FC = () => {
  return <Player {...otherProps} logLevel="trace" />;
};
```

:::note
Don't enable this prop for production as it may lead to slowdown.
:::

To observe prefetching events, add [`logLevel: "trace"`](/docs/prefetch#options) to your [`prefetch()`](/docs/prefetch) calls, if there are any:

```tsx twoslash title='Adding logLevel: "trace" to prefetch()'
const src = 'https://example.com';
// ---cut---
import {prefetch} from 'remotion';

prefetch(src, {
  logLevel: 'trace',
});
```

## Reporting issues

We have implemented exact logging of relevant events so in order to improve how Remotion handles media playback.  
We are encouraging you to file feedback. If you would like to report feedback, please:

<div>
  <Step>1</Step> <span>Ensure you are at least on v4.0.262 of Remotion. Previous versions had known bugs.</span>
</div>
<div>
  <Step>2</Step>{' '}
  <span>
    <a href="#enable-logging">ensure you are using the best practices described above.</a>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <Step>3</Step>
  <a href="#enable-logging">enable logging</a> and send all logs during playback alongside your report.
</div>
