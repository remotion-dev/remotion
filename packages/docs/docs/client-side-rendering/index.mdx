Client-side rendering is a new additional capability of Remotion that allows you to render videos, images, and audio directly in the browser, without requiring server-side infrastructure.

It is currently in development and will be released as a new package called `@remotion/web-renderer`.

## Key differences from server-side rendering

Unlike server-side rendering with [`@remotion/renderer`](/docs/renderer), client-side rendering:

- Runs in the browser - No need to setup Node servers or Remotion Lambda
- Encodes with WebCodecs using [Mediabunny](/docs/mediabunny) instead of FFmpeg
- Limited to a subset of HTML elements - see [limitations](/docs/client-side-rendering/limitations)
- No bundling step - takes components and video config directly

## APIs

The package will provide APIs called `renderStillOnWeb()` and `renderMediaOnWeb()`.

Here is an example of how to use it:

```tsx twoslash title="Tentative API example"
import {renderMediaOnWeb} from '@remotion/web-renderer';

const Component: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="100" height="100" style={{transform: 'rotate(45deg)'}}>
      <polygon points="50,10 90,90 10,90" fill="orange" />
    </svg>
  );
};

const {blob} = await renderMediaOnWeb({
  composition: {
    component: Component,
    durationInFrames: 100,
    fps: 30,
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    calculateMetadata: null,
    id: 'my-composition',
  },
  inputProps: {},
});
```
