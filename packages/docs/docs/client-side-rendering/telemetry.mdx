title: Telemetry in client-side rendering
---

:::warning
Very experimental feature - expect bugs and breaking changes at any time.  
[Track progress on GitHub](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/issues/5913) and discuss in the [`#web-renderer`](https://remotion.dev/discord) channel on Discord.
:::

[Client-side rendering](/docs/client-side-rendering) has telemetry that sends an event for every render performed using the [`@remotion/licensing`](/docs/licensing) package.

Remotion has a [license](/docs/license) that makes it free for individuals and small companies but requires a paid license for bigger companies, whose price is determined by the amount of renders.

## Sent information

The following information is sent:

- IP Address
- Domain name (e.g. `https://remotion.dev`)
- Whether this render was in production or development
- Whether this render was a video or a still image

No information about the content or metadata of the video rendered, or any user data is collected.

The telemetry is designed to collect as little data as possible while ensuring accountability, and if configured with a license key makes it easy for companies to keep track of their render count.

## Setting a license key

If you [qualify for the free license](/docs/license), you don't need to register for a license key.  
Pass `"free-license"` to `licenseKey` to disable any warning in the console and declare your eligibility for the free license.

```tsx twoslash title="Setting a license key" {6}
import React from 'react';
const Component: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="100" height="100" style={{transform: 'rotate(45deg)'}}>
      <polygon points="50,10 90,90 10,90" fill="orange" />
    </svg>
  );
};

const composition = {
  component: Component,
  durationInFrames: 100,
  fps: 30,
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
  calculateMetadata: null,
  id: 'my-composition',
};

// ---cut---
import {renderMediaOnWeb} from '@remotion/web-renderer';

await renderMediaOnWeb({
  composition,
  inputProps: {},
  licenseKey: 'free-license',
});
```

If you have a Remotion Company License or Enterprise License, go to [remotion.pro](https://remotion.pro) and get your license key from the "Usage" tab.

```tsx twoslash title="Declare eligibility for the free licnse" {6}
import React from 'react';
const Component: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="100" height="100" style={{transform: 'rotate(45deg)'}}>
      <polygon points="50,10 90,90 10,90" fill="orange" />
    </svg>
  );
};

const composition = {
  component: Component,
  durationInFrames: 100,
  fps: 30,
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
  calculateMetadata: null,
  id: 'my-composition',
};

// ---cut---
import {renderMediaOnWeb} from '@remotion/web-renderer';

await renderMediaOnWeb({
  composition,
  inputProps: {},
  licenseKey: 'rm_pub_abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890',
});
```

For tracking client-side renders, you should use the public key.  
You can now track your usage on the same Usage tab.

:::note
Usage is not (yet) tied to billing.  
You will need to update your render count manually periodically to reflect your usage.
