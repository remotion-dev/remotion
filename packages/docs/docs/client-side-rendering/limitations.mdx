This feature is not available yet, but we are already writing docs.

## Supported element types

There is no browser API for capturing the entire viewport.  
Client-side rendering reconstructs the DOM in a `<canvas>` element, but only certain elements and CSS styles are supported.

- `<canvas>` elements
- `<svg>` elements
- [`<Img>`](/docs/img) elements - supported, but subject to CORS restrictions
- [`<Audio>`](/docs/media/audio) elements
- [`<Video>`](/docs/media/video) elements
- [`<Gif>`](/docs/gif), [`<AnimatedImage>`](/docs/animatedimage), [`<Lottie>`](/docs/lottie), [`<Rive>`](/docs/rive) elements

You can use HTML elements like `<div>` to influence the layout of the elements, but they will not be captured visually.

```tsx
import {AbsoluteFill, Img, staticFile} from 'remotion';

export const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    /* Using Flexbox to center the elements is supported */
    <div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center'}}>
      {/** This text will NOT be captured but it influences the layout */}
      <div>Hello world</div>
      {/** This image WILL be captured because it is a supported element type */}
      <Img src={staticFile('image.png')} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Supported CSS styles

Only some CSS styles are being supported:

- Positioning and layouting properties, such as `margin`, `left`, `display`, `width`, `height`, `flex`, `flex-direction`.  
  Remotion is able to obtain the position of the element in the DOM, no matter which CSS properties are used
- Transformations, such as `transform`, `rotate`, `scale`, `translate`, `perspective`, `matrix`, `matrix3d`
- `border-radius`
- `display: none`
- `opacity`
- `style` property on `<svg>` elements is supported, since the browser can capture SVG elements:

```tsx twoslash title="✅ Works: SVG elements can be styled with CSS"
<svg style={{backgroundColor: 'red'}}>
  <rect width="100%" height="100%" />
</svg>
```

## Uncapturable elements and styles

Every element and style that is not explicitly supported is unsupported. Some important omissions are:

<!-- TODO: Block Html5Video from being used -->

❌ Unsupported elements:

- `<Html5Video>`, `<Html5Audio>` and `<OffthreadVideo>` from the `remotion` package
- Text elements: `<div>`, `<span>`, `<h1>`, etc.
- Any other element not listed above.

❌ Unsupported styles:

- `background`
- `color`
- `opacity`
- `mask-image` or `clip-path`
- `border`,
- `box-shadow`
- `z-index`
- Any other property not listed above.

```tsx twoslash title="❌ Doesn't work: Cannot capture styles that don't change the layout"
<canvas style={{backgroundColor: 'red'}} />
```

```tsx twoslash title="✅ Works: Styles that change the layout"
<canvas style={{position: 'absolute', top: 100, left: 100}} />
```

Over time, we will support more elements and styles. We'll prioritize the most demanded ones.

To get a better understanding of what works and what doesn't, read [how client-side rendering works](/docs/client-side-rendering/how-it-works) under the hood.

## Z-indexing

The CSS property `z-index` is not supported.  
To control the order of the elements, [order your elements from back to front](/docs/layers).

```tsx twoslash title="The blue square will be drawn on top of the red square"
import {AbsoluteFill} from 'remotion';

// ---cut---
const MyComp = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <AbsoluteFill>
        <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
          <rect x="0" y="0" width="100" height="100" fill="red" />
        </svg>
      </AbsoluteFill>
      <AbsoluteFill>
        <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
          <rect x="0" y="0" width="100" height="100" fill="blue" />
        </svg>
      </AbsoluteFill>
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

## Video and media constraints

The limitations from [`@remotion/media`](/docs/media/support) apply.

## Single concurrency

There is no multithreading for client-side rendering.  
However, it is fundamentally more efficient because there is less interprocess communication.  
In addition, in the headful browser, GPU is usually available, which brings performance benefits.
