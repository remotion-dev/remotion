To check whether somebody used Remotion to generate a video:

## Check video metadata

Drag the video into [remotion.dev/convert](https://www.remotion.dev/convert) and inspect the metadata in the left panel.  
If the video was generated with Remotion, it will include metadata such as `Made with Remotion v4.0.372`.

Alternatively, you can use `ffprobe` in the command line:

```bash
ffprobe your_video.mp4
```

The output will include a line like `comment=Made with Remotion v4.0.372`.

## Look for the Remotion Player icon

On a website that uses the Remotion Player, the Play button is rounded like the Remotion logo, unless the controls are disabled or the play button was customized.

## Check for Remotion in the DevTools

Open the DevTools and check if the variable `window.remotion_imported` is defined.
