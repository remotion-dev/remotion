Ask your questions and report problems with Remotion in public.

- We can refer to this conversation later instead of typing out our answer again.
- Other people than the Remotion team can also answer questions.
- The resource can be found through search engines and chat interfaces.
- We train [Remotion AI](/docs/ai) with public conversations.

We need to offer our support efficiently, therefore we do not answer questions via direct message or email.

### Exceptions

- If your problem includes private information that you cannot share, you can DM us once we approve of it.
- [Enterprise License](https://remotion.pro/license) holders get a dedicated private Slack or Discord channel.
- [Consulting sessions](https://cal.com/remotion/consulting) and [Evaluation calls](https://cal.com/remotion/evaluate)
