title: Accessibility statement for Remotion
crumb: 'FAQ'

This page documents how Remotion ensures its products meet accessibility standards.  
This is a common question we get from enterprises who need to ensure their suppliers meet accessibility standards.

## Remotion Player

The Remotion Player is the component that most users will embed into their page if they are working on a Remotion app.  
We do believe that the Remotion Player meets modern accessibility standards:

- Keyboard navigation is possible
- Clear focus indicators are present
- Buttons have appropriate labels
- Contrast ratios are sufficient

## Editor Starter

Out of the box, we try to follow these best practices:

- Keyboard navigation is possible
- Clear focus indicators
- Buttons have appropriate labels
- Contrast ratios are sufficient

The Editor Starter is a template whose code is being adopted into customer code bases.  
It therefore becomes the responsibility of the customer to ensure that the Editor Starter meets their desired accessibility standards.

## Remotion Studio

The Remotion Studio is not considered a product for end-users, but a helper tool for developers.  
While we think it is doing well in terms of accessibility, we are not giving any guarantees on its accessibility.

## Other products

Do not expose any user interfaces and are therefore not subject to accessibility concerns.

## Templates

Are not part of the core Remotion framework and explicitly excluded from this accessibility statement.  
If using a template, users must ensure themselves that the code they adopt meets their desired accessibility standards.

## Reporting an accessibility issue

You may [file an issue](https://remotion.dev/issue) to report an accessibility issue.  
We will do our best to address any issues you report.

Customers eligible for [prioritized support](/docs/support) may also report issues through the channels set up for them.

## Certifications

Remotion does not currently hold any accessibility certifications.  
If you are interested in that Remotion obtains certain certifications, contact us at hi@remotion.dev to discuss this as an add-on for your Enterprise License.
