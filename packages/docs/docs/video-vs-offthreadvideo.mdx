We offer two components for including other videos in your video: [`<Video />`](/docs/video) and [`<OffthreadVideo />`](/docs/offthreadvideo).  
This page offers a comparison to help you decide which tag to use.

## [`<OffthreadVideo />`](/docs/offthreadvideo)

:::info
Prefer [`<OffthreadVideo />`](/docs/offthreadvideo) whenever possible.
:::

A more sophisticated way of embedding a video, which:

- **During preview:** renders a HTML5 `<video>` tag.
- **While rendering:** Extracts the exact frame outside the browser and displays it in an [`<Img>`](/docs/img) tag.

**Pros**

✅ &nbsp; More videos can be displayed simulatenously as Chrome will not apply throttling.  
✅ &nbsp; No flickers or duplicate frames in the output video can occur.  
✅ &nbsp; Supports more codecs such as ProRes (only during render-time).  
✅ &nbsp; Is usually faster to render.

**Cons**

⛔ &nbsp; The video needs to be downloaded fully before a frame can be rendered.  
⛔ &nbsp; Supports transparent videos only if the [`transparent`](/docs/offthreadvideo#transparent) prop is set which is a bit slower.

## [`<Video />`](/docs/video)

Is based on the native HTML5 `<video>` element and therefore behaves similar to it.

**Pros**

✅ &nbsp; Can render a video without having it to be downloaded fully (if you don't pass the [`muted`](/docs/video/#muted) prop, the video will still be downloaded fully to extract its audio).  
✅ &nbsp; You can attach a ref to the `<video>` element.

**Cons**

⛔ &nbsp; Fewer codecs are supported.  
⛔ &nbsp; Chrome may throttle video tags if the page is heavy.  
⛔ &nbsp; If too many video tags get rendered simultaneously, a timeout may occur.  
⛔ &nbsp; If the input video framerate does not match with the output framerate, some duplicate frames may occur in the output.
