When including videos from Pexels, especially when rendering on Remotion Lambda, you may encounter the following error:

```
A delayRender() 'Loading <Html5Video> duration with src="https://videos.pexels.com/video-files/5182920/5182920-hd_720_1280_25fps.mp4"' was called but not cleared after 28000ms.
```

or

```
A delayRender() "Loading <Img> with src=http://localhost:3000/proxy?src=https://videos.pexels.com/video-files/5182920/5182920-hd_720_1280_25fps.mp4" was called but not cleared after 28000ms. See https://remotion.dev/docs/timeout for help
```

## Problem

Pexels throttles (artificially slows down network speed) videos when they are requested often.  
Since each of the many Lambda functions spawned loads the video, it leads to a lot of requests in a short amount of time.

These timeouts are not a problem from Remotion's side.

## Solution

Instead of using direct links from services like Pexels, download and re-host the videos on your own servers, or in a S3 bucket.
