title: Can I render videos in the browser?
crumb: 'FAQ'

Rendering videos in the browser is currently not supported.  
In order to render videos, you need to hook up [server-side rendering](/docs/ssr), [Remotion Lambda](/docs/lambda), or [render videos locally](/docs/render).

## Our future plan

**We are planning to add support for rendering videos in the browser in the future.**  
As of September 2025, this is our biggest priority on the roadmap and the feature is in the works.

The biggest limitation is that there is no way to capture the browser viewport.

Therefore, with browser rendering, only certain tags will be supported, such as `<canvas>`, `<svg>`, `<Video>` and `<Img>`. Also, `<Audio>` can be processed.

It will still be possible to layout these tags using `<div>`'s and CSS, since Remotion will be able to programmatically determine the position of the elements.
Remotion will extract canvas-like elements from the DOM and compose them.  
This keeps the possibility to have event handlers like `onPointerDown` attached to them. We hope this is more productive than to just have one `<canvas>` element and disable event handlers and CSS layouting.

The encoding of the video will work with [Mediabunny](/docs/mediabunny).  
We hope to launch this mode in late 2025.

## Future-proofing your code

To prepare yourself for client-side rendering, update your code:

- to use the [`useRemotionEnvironment()`](/docs/use-remotion-environment) hook instead of `getRemotionEnvironment()`
- to use the [`useDelayRender()`](/docs/use-delay-render) hook instead of `delayRender()`
- Ensure your assets are available via CORS, so the client-side can access them
