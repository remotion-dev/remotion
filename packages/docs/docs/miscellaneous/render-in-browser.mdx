title: Can I render videos in the browser?
crumb: 'FAQ'
---

Rendering videos in the browser is currently not supported.  
In order to render videos, you need to hook up [server-side rendering](/docs/ssr), [Remotion Lambda](/docs/lambda), or [render videos locally](/docs/render).

## Our future plan

**We are planning to add support for rendering videos in the browser in the future** - with some [limitations](/docs/client-side-rendering/limitations).  
See [Client-side rendering](/docs/client-side-rendering) for an overview of the project.

We hope to launch this mode in late 2025.
