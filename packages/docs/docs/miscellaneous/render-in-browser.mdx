title: Can I render videos in the browser?
crumb: 'FAQ'
---

Rendering videos in the browser is currently not supported.  
In order to render videos, you need to hook up [server-side rendering](/docs/ssr), [Remotion Lambda](/docs/lambda), or [render videos locally](/docs/render).

## Our future plan

**We are planning to add support for rendering videos in the browser in the future** - with some [limitations](/docs/client-side-rendering/limitations).  
See [Client-side rendering](/docs/client-side-rendering) for an overview of the project.

We hope to launch this mode in late 2025.

## Future-proofing your code

To prepare yourself for client-side rendering, update your code:

- to use the [`useRemotionEnvironment()`](/docs/use-remotion-environment) hook instead of `getRemotionEnvironment()`
- to use the [`useDelayRender()`](/docs/use-delay-render) hook instead of `delayRender()`, `continueRender()` and `cancelRender()`
- Ensure your assets are available via CORS, so the client-side can access them
