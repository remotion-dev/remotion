title: Can I render videos using Vercel Serverless functions?
crumb: 'FAQ'
---

It is currently not possible to render videos or stills on Vercel Serverless functions due to the 50MB maximum function size. Since Chromium is a dependency of Remotion, it alone almost entirely fills the quota available.

However, you can trigger a Remotion Lambda render through a Vercel Serverless function â€“ our preferred choice for building applications. See our [Next template](https://github.com/remotion-dev/template-next) or [GitHub Unwrapped project](https://github.com/remotion-dev/github-unwrapped-2022) for an example of how to do so.

## Can I render videos in Next.js?

If you don't deploy to Vercel, it might be possible to render videos in API routes using the [server-side rendering](/docs/ssr) primitives.  
Check if your provider has enough disk space for Chromium and Remotion and has sufficient CPU and RAM to render videos. See [this page](/docs/miscellaneous/nextjs#while-self-hosting-nextjs) for more details.

**Recommendation:**

If you plan to deploy to Vercel, we recommend to trigger Remotion Lambda renders from Vercel Serverless functions. See our [Next template](https://github.com/remotion-dev/template-next) or [GitHub Unwrapped 2022 project](https://github.com/remotion-dev/github-unwrapped-2022) for an example of how to do so.

If you plan to deploy to a server, [see here](http://localhost:3000/docs/miscellaneous/nextjs#while-self-hosting-nextjs).
