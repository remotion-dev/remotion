## No native support

Remotion does not currently support HLS / HTTP Live streaming / `.m3u8` files natively.  
It is a technically difficult feature to add because:

- There is no native support for it in the browser.
- FFmpeg does not treat it like other video formats when extracting frames using the low-level API.

For Remotion to support HLS and take full advantage of only taking the relevant portion of the video while rendering, we'd need to implement our custom parser which takes a lot of time given the long specification.

## Using hls.js to play HLS videos during Preview

You can play HLS videos during preview in the [`<Player>`](/docs/player) and in the Remotion Studio.

Note the following caveats:

<Step>1</Step> This code only shows how to connect the video tag to the HLS
stream, it has not been tested on a real project. <br />
<Step>2</Step> Audio will not work when rendering a video to an MP4 using this
code. Use an alternative source during rendering. See <a href="/docs/miscellaneous/snippets/offthread-video-while-rendering">
  &lt;OffthreadVideo&gt; while rendering
</a> and <a href="/docs/get-remotion-environment">
  <code>getRemotionEnvironment()</code>
</a> for how to use different components based on whether you are rendering or
previewing.

```tsx twoslash title="HlsDemo.tsx"
import Hls from 'hls.js';
import React, {useEffect, useRef} from 'react';
import {AbsoluteFill, RemotionVideoProps, Video} from 'remotion';

const HlsVideo: React.FC<RemotionVideoProps> = ({src}) => {
  const videoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!src) {
      throw new Error('src is required');
    }

    const startFrom = 0;

    const hls = new Hls({
      startLevel: 4,
      maxBufferLength: 5,
      maxMaxBufferLength: 5,
    });

    hls.on(Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED, () => {
      hls.startLoad(startFrom);
    });

    hls.loadSource(src);
    hls.attachMedia(videoRef.current!);

    return () => {
      hls.destroy();
    };
  }, [src]);

  return <Video ref={videoRef} src={src} />;
};

export const HlsDemo: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <HlsVideo src="https://stream.mux.com/nqGuji1CJuoPoU3iprRRhiy3HXiQN0201HLyliOg44HOU.m3u8" />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```
