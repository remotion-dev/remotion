## No native support

Remotion does not currently support HLS / HTTP Live streaming / `.m3u8` files natively.  
It is a technically difficult feature to add because:

- There is no native support for it in the browser.
- HLS is a special case, where video is split up into different files, and one file may contain many video or audio streams.

We will support HLS through [`@remotion/media`](/docs/media/video) once [Mediabunny](/docs/mediabunny) has added support for it.  
While we don't control the timeline, we have mutually agreed that HLS should be put high on the roadmap.
[Follow the status of this issue here](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny/issues/89).

## Using hls.js to play HLS videos during Preview

You can play HLS videos during preview in the [`<Player>`](/docs/player) and in the Remotion Studio.

Note the following caveats:

<Step>1</Step> This code only shows how to connect the video tag to the HLS stream, it has not been tested on a real project. <br />
<Step>2</Step> Audio will not work when rendering a video to an MP4 using this code. Use an alternative source during rendering. See <a href="/docs/video-tags#using-a-different-tag-in-preview-and-rendering">&lt;OffthreadVideo&gt; while rendering</a> and
<a href="/docs/use-remotion-environment">
  <code>useRemotionEnvironment()</code>
</a>
for how to use different components based on whether you are rendering or previewing.

```tsx twoslash title="HlsDemo.tsx"
import Hls from 'hls.js';
import React, {useEffect, useRef} from 'react';
import {AbsoluteFill, RemotionVideoProps, Html5Video} from 'remotion';

const HlsVideo: React.FC<RemotionVideoProps> = ({src}) => {
  const videoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!src) {
      throw new Error('src is required');
    }

    const startFrom = 0;

    const hls = new Hls({
      startLevel: 4,
      maxBufferLength: 5,
      maxMaxBufferLength: 5,
    });

    hls.on(Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED, () => {
      hls.startLoad(startFrom);
    });

    hls.loadSource(src);
    hls.attachMedia(videoRef.current!);

    return () => {
      hls.destroy();
    };
  }, [src]);

  return <Html5Video ref={videoRef} src={src} />;
};

export const HlsDemo: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <HlsVideo src="https://stream.mux.com/nqGuji1CJuoPoU3iprRRhiy3HXiQN0201HLyliOg44HOU.m3u8" />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```
