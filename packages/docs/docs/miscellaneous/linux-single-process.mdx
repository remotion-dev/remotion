:::info
This document is outdated. As of 4.0.137, the default behavior is to use multi-process mode.  
The setting still exists, but is `true` by default.
:::

By default, Remotion starts the Chromium browser on Linux with the `--single-process` flag. This is because:

- The sandboxing feature of Chromium is not supported on all Linux distributions
- Older versions of Chromium used to crash when starting headlessly with multiple processes
- If some desktop libraries are missing, Chromium could crash on startup on some Distros.

This can lead to degraded rendering performance, especially when trying to leverage high-core CPUs and high Remotion concurrency.

## Enable multi-process rendering on Linux

_available from v4.0.42_

Enabled by default. To disable multi-process mode for Chromium during rendering on Linux:

- **renderMedia()** / **openBrowser()** / **renderFrames()**: Use the [`chromiumOptions.enableMultiProcessOnLinux`](/docs/renderer/render-media#enablemultiprocessonlinux) option.
- **CLI**: Use the [`--enable-multi-process-on-linux=false`](/docs/cli/render#--enable-multiprocess-on-linux) flag.
- **Config file**: Use the [`Config.setChromiumMultiProcessInLinux()`](/docs/config#setchromiummultiprocessonlinux) option.
- **Remotion Studio**: Check the toggle in the advanced settings.
- **Cloud Run**: From v4.0.42, this option is automatically enabled.
- **Lambda**: This option is disabled with no option to enable it because on Amazon Linux, Chrome will crash if the `--single-process` flag is not used. We recommend using more Lambdas instead of more concurrency per Lambda.

## Should I enable multi-process mode?

The answer depends on the Linux environment. If you are running Remotion on a server, you should try to enable multi-process mode and see if it works.

Our recommended [Docker](/docs/docker) image is confirmed working with multi-process mode enabled.
