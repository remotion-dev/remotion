title: Which video formats does Remotion support?
sidebar_label: Video formats
---

Remotion supports a variety of video codecs.

**Output formats**: Videos can be rendered to `H.264` (MP4), `H.265`, (HEVC), `VP8` and `VP9` (WebM), `ProRes` as well as GIFs. See the [Encoding guide](/docs/encoding) for more detail.

**Codecs supported for [`<Video>`](/docs/media/video):** Remotion uses WebCodecs and [Mediabunny](/docs/mediabunny) for playback. See the [Supported formats and codecs for `@remotion/media`](/docs/media/support) page for more details.

**Codecs supported for [`<Html5Video>`](/docs/html5-video):** Remotion uses the default `<video>` tag for playback and therefore inherits codec support from the browser.  
During rendering this means that the Chrome codecs are supported. In the [Remotion Studio](/docs/terminology/studio) and in the [Player](/docs/terminology/player), the codec support from the browser in which the webpage is hosted in applies.  
Codec support varies between browsers and changes from time to time. Refer to this [MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs) for browser support.

:::note
Prior to v4.0.18, if you did not have a local copy of Chrome, Remotion would download a copy of Chromium which [would not support the proprietary H.264 and H.265 codecs](/docs/miscellaneous/chrome-headless-shell).
:::

**Codecs supported for [`<OffthreadVideo>`](/docs/offthreadvideo)**: The same support that applies to `<Html5Video>` applies to `<OffthreadVideo>` as well, however, more codecs can be supported during rendering since FFmpeg is used under the hood to read the video file. We however don't maintain an exact list of supported video codecs.
