# Chrome Headless Shell<AvailableFrom v="4.0.137"/>

Remotion will download [Chrome Headless Shell](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-headless-shell) if no local browser can be found and an API for rendering videos is used.

## Supported platforms

The following platforms are supported:

- Linux (x64)
- Windows (x64)
- macOS (x64 and arm64)

:::note
[Remotion Lambda](/docs/lambda) is also support despite being arm64 on Linux.
:::

## Ensure a local browser is found

// TODO: Add CLI variant

Use [`ensureBrowser()`](/docs/renderer/ensure-browser) to ensure a local browser is found. This function will download Chrome Headless Shell if no local browser is found.

## Bring your own binary

If you don't want Chrome Headless Shell to get installed or your platform is not supported, you need to specify your own Chromium-based browser:

- Using the [`setBrowserExecutable()`](/docs/config#setbrowserexecutable) option in the config file (for the CLI)
- Using the [`browserExecutable`](/docs/renderer/render-media) option in [`renderMedia()`](/docs/renderer/render-media) and other SSR APIs

In [Lambda](/docs/lambda) and [Cloud Run](/docs/cloudrun), a version of Chrome is already installed, so you don't need to do anything.

:::note
In a future version, Chrome will stop shipping the headless mode in their desktop browser and you will need to use the Chrome Headless Shell
:::

## Download location

Chrome Headless Shell will download to

```
node_modules/.remotion/chrome-headless-shell/[platform]/chrome-headless-shell-[platform]
```

`platform` can be one of `mac-arm64`, `mac-x64`, `linux64` or `win64`.

At this path, a folder with the necessary files will be created.  
An executable `./chrome-headless-shell` (`.\chrome-headless-shell.exe` on Windows) will be created.

## Chrome vs. Chrome Headless Shell

Chrome used to ship with a `--headless` flag, which Remotion would use.

As of Chrome 123, the headless mode is split up into:

- `--headless=old`, which is ideal for screenshotting (and therefore Remotion)
- `--headless=new`, which is ideal for browser testing

`--headless=old` will stop working in a future version of Chrome.  
The old headless mode is being extracted into "Chrome Headless Shell".

Hence we encourage you to use Chrome Headless Shell to future-proof your Remotion application.

## Chrome vs. Chromium

Chromium is the open-source project that Chrome is based on. Some versions of Chromium don't the necessary codecs for the [`<Video >`](/docs/video) tag as well as for functions in [`@remotion/media-utils`](/docs/media-utils).

This is why we recommend Chrome over Chromium.

## Changes in Remotion v5.0

Remotion 5.0 will not recognize your regular Chrome browser anymore.  
You will need to use Chrome Headless Shell, because Chrome is [discontinuing the `--headless=old`](#chrome-vs-chrome-headless-shell) mode.

## Thorium (v4.0.18 - v4.0.135)

In these versions, if no local browser can be found, an instance of [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks/) is downloaded.

Thorium is a free and open-source browser forked off Chromium, which includes the codecs needed to render videos.

## Chromium (before v4.0.18)

In previous versions, Remotion would download the free version of Chromium, which would not include codecs for the proprietary H.264 and H.265 codecs.
This would often lead to problems when using the [`<Video>`](/docs/video) tag.
