_Part of the `@remotion/media-utils` package of helper functions._

:::note
Deprecated: Does not support H.265 videos on Linux and also fails on some other formats.  
Use [`parseMedia()`](/docs/media-parser/parse-media) to get video metadata instead, which is faster and supports more formats.
:::

:::note
Only works in the browser.
:::

Takes a `src` to a video, loads it and returns metadata for the specified source.

## Arguments

### `src`

A string pointing to an asset.

## Return value

`Promise<VideoMetadata>` - object with information about the video data:

- `durationInSeconds`: `number` The duration of the video in seconds.
- `width`: `number` The width of the video in pixels.
- `height`: `number` The height of the video in pixels.
- `aspectRatio`: `number` Video width divided by video height.
- `isRemote`: `boolean` Whether the video was imported locally or from a different origin.

:::warning
`durationInSeconds` may return `Infinity`. This happens if the duration of the video is not stored in the beginning of the file.  
This is for example the case for videos that are recorded with a webcam and being encoded while the recording is still in progress.  
Ensure handling for `Infinity` for user-provided videos and re-encode videos with FFmpeg to move the duration to the beginning of the file.
:::

## Example

```tsx twoslash
import {staticFile} from 'remotion';
// ---cut---
import {getVideoMetadata} from '@remotion/media-utils';

await getVideoMetadata(staticFile('video.mp4')); /* {
  durationInSeconds: 100.00,
  width: 1280,
  height: 720,
  aspectRatio: 1.77777778,
  isRemote: false
} */
await getVideoMetadata('https://example.com/remote-audio.webm'); /* {
  durationInSeconds: 40.213,
  width: 1920,
  height: 1080,
  aspectRatio: 1.77777778,
  isRemote: true
} */
```

## Caching behavior

This function is memoizing the results it returns.
If you pass in the same argument to `src` multiple times, it will return a cached version from the second time on, regardless of if the file has changed. To clear the cache, you have to reload the page.
