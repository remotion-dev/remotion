# installWhisperCpp()<AvailableFrom v="4.0.115"/>

Installs a Whisper.cpp version into a folder.

```tsx twoslash title="install-whisper.mjs"
import path from 'path';
import {installWhisperCpp} from '@remotion/install-whisper-cpp';

const {alreadyExisted} = await installWhisperCpp({
  to: path.join(process.cwd(), 'whisper.cpp'),
  version: '1.5.5', // A Whisper.cpp semver or git tag
});
```

On Windows, if the provided version is not in semantic version format (e.g., `1.5.4`), the installation will throw an error. The function expects a precompiled semantic versioned release available for download.

On other platforms, the source is cloned from GitHub and built.

If you install Whisper.cpp into a folder which is in a Git repository, you should add the folder to the `.gitignore` file.

If the output folder already exists, the function will not do anything and return `{ alreadyExisted: true }`.

You also need to download a model for Whisper.cpp to work. You can do this with the [`downloadWhisperModel()`](/docs/install-whisper-cpp/download-whisper-model) function.

## Options

### `to`

The folder to install Whisper.cpp into.

### `version`

The version of Whisper.cpp to install. Don't include the `v` prefix.
This can be either a hash of a Whisper.cpp commit or a semantic version of an official release.

:::info
On Windows, currently only release tags of Whisper.cpp are supported (e.g `1.5.4`).
:::

### `printOutput?`

Whether to print the output of the installation process to the console. Defaults to `true`.

### `signal?`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.156" />

A signal from an [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) to cancel the installation process.

## Return value

Returns a `Promise` that resolves to an object with the following property:

### `alreadyExisted`

Whether the folder already existed. If it did, and contains the necessary executable, the function did not perform any installation and returned `true`. If the executable is missing in the existing folder, the function expects manual deletion of the folder before attempting another installation.
