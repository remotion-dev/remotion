## Our company structure

We are incorporated in Switzerland as an Aktiengesellschaft.  
The founder team (Jonny and Mehmet) is still in control of the board seats and the vast majority of the shares.

## Revenue

In 2024, Remotion was [slightly profitable](https://x.com/JNYBGR/status/1892128469569458199), and in 2025, we grew signficantly.

## Fundraising

We are **not looking to raise** any more funding.  
This might be surprising to a lot of people, but we think it's the best for us.

- **We are profitable** and are able to slowly grow our tech and business organically.
- **We're getting things done** - thanks to AI we are moving faster than ever and we have volunteer and paid contributors who are helping us.
- **We're driven by fun, independence and innovation** and are thriving not being under pressure.
- **We are not trying to build one big product** - We are building tech that you can combine with other tools. Anyone can license our tech!
- We're coming from **indie hacker and open source culture** - being who we are is a big part of why people like Remotion.

## Customers

Remotion has over 150 active customers, making us very diversified.  
Our goal is to make Remotion a framework that works for everyone, not favoring any specific customer.

## Shark Tank appearance

In 2024, we [appeared on the Swiss version of Shark Tank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzY1ukohYdA).  
We filled in as a last-minute replacement for a startup which already got funded in the meanwhile.

We were not actively looking for a new financing round, but saw this as a great opportunity for exposing and challening ourselves.  
Keep this in mind while watching this, nonetheless this is a great watch to learn more about our company!
