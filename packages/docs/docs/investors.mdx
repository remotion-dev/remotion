## Our company structure

We are incorporated in Switzerland as an Aktiengesellschaft.  
The founder team (Jonny and Mehmet) is still in control of the board seats and the vast majority of the shares.

## Revenue

In 2024, Remotion was [slightly profitable](https://x.com/JNYBGR/status/1892128469569458199), and in 2025, we grew signficantly.

## Fundraising

We are not looking to raise any more money at the moment because:

- we are profitable
- we are comfortable with our pace of growth
- there would be significant structural overhead associated if we did another funding round which would only be worth it if we raised a lot more money than we need

## Customers

Remotion has over 150 active customers, making us very diversified.  
Our goal is to make Remotion a framework that works for everyone, not favoring any specific customer.

## Shark Tank appearance

In 2024, we [appeared on the Swiss version of Shark Tank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzY1ukohYdA).  
We filled in as a last-minute replacement for a startup which already got funded in the meanwhile.

We were not actively looking for a new financing round, but saw this as a great opportunity for exposing and challening ourselves.  
Keep this in mind while watching this, nonetheless this is a great watch to learn more about our company!
