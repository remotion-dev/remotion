_Part of the [`@remotion/media-parser`](/docs/media-parser) package._
_available from v4.0.190_

:::warning
**Unstable API**: This package is experimental. The API may change in the future.  
The API for getting video metadata is stable and may be used in production.
:::

## Examples

```tsx twoslash title="Parsing a hosted video"
import {parseMedia} from '@remotion/media-parser';

const result = await parseMedia({
  src: 'https://example.com/my-video.mp4',
  fields: {
    durationInSeconds: true,
    dimensions: true,
  },
});

console.log(result.durationInSeconds); // 10
console.log(result.dimensions); // {width: 1920, height: 1080}
```

```tsx twoslash title="Parsing a local file"
import {parseMedia} from '@remotion/media-parser';
import {nodeReader} from '@remotion/media-parser/node';

const result = await parseMedia({
  src: '/Users/jonnyburger/Downloads/my-video.mp4',
  fields: {
    durationInSeconds: true,
    dimensions: true,
  },
  reader: nodeReader,
});
```

## API

:::warning
**Unstable API**: This package is experimental. The API may change in the future.  
The API for getting video metadata is stable and may be used in production.
:::

### `src`

Either a local file path, or a URL, or a `File` or `Blob` object.  
If you pass a local file path, you must also pass [`nodeReader`](/docs/media-parser/node-reader) as the `reader` argument.  
If you pass a `File` object, you must also pass [`webFileReader`](/docs/media-parser/web-file-reader) as the `reader` argument.

### `fields?`

An object specifying which fields you'd like to receive.  
If you like to receive the field, pass `true` as the value.

See [Available Fields](/docs/media-parser/fields) for a list of available fields.

### `reader?`

A reader interface.  
Default value: `fetchReader`, which uses `fetch()` to read the video.  
If you pass [`nodeReader`](/docs/media-parser/node-reader), you must also pass a local file path as the `src` argument.
If you pass [`webFileReader`](/docs/media-parser/web-file-reader), you must also pass a `File` as the `src` argument.

### `controller?`

A [controller](/docs/media-parser/media-parser-controller) object that allows you to pause, resume and abort the parsing process.

### `onVideoTrack?`

A callback that is called when a video track is detected.  
It receives an object with `track` and `container` (API not yet stable).  
You must return either `null` or a callback that is called for each sample that corresponds to the video track.

The `sample` has the type `VideoSample` and while not all fields are stable, it has all the mandatory fields for the [`EncodedVideoChunk`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EncodedVideoChunk) constructor.

```tsx twoslash title="Reading video frames"
import {parseMedia, OnVideoTrack} from '@remotion/media-parser';

const onVideoTrack: OnVideoTrack = ({track}) => {
  console.log(track);

  return (sample) => {
    console.log(new EncodedVideoChunk(sample));
  };
};
```

### `onAudioTrack?`

A callback that is called when an audio track is detected.  
It receives an object with `track` and `container` (API not yet stable).  
You must return either `null` or a callback that is called for each sample that corresponds to the audio track.

The `sample` has the type `AudioSample` and while not all fields are stable, it has all the mandatory fields for the [`EncodedAudioChunk`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EncodedAudioChunk) constructor.

```tsx twoslash title="Reading audio frames"
// @noErrors
import {parseMedia, OnAudioTrack} from '@remotion/media-parser';

const onAudioTrack: OnAudioTrack = ({track}) => {
  console.log(track);

  return (sample) => {
    console.log(new EncodedAudioChunk(sample));
  };
};
```

### `selectM3uStream?`

A callback that is called when a `.m3u8` file is detected which has multiple streams.  
See [Stream selection](/docs/media-parser/stream-selection) for an example.

### `selectM3uAssociatedPlaylists?`

A callback that is called after a M3U stream has been selected, allowing you to pick which auxiliary playlists should be parsed. Usually this is used for selecting an audio track.  
See [Stream selection](/docs/media-parser/stream-selection) for an example.

### `onParseProgress?`

A callback that is called from time to time when bytes have been read from the media.  
It includes the following data:

```tsx twoslash
import {ParseMediaProgress} from '@remotion/media-parser';
//          ^?
```

:::note
You may make this an async function, and while it is not resolved, **the parsing process will be paused**.  
This is useful if you want to add a small delay inbetween progress steps to keep the UI interactive.
:::

### `progressIntervalInMs?`

_number_

The interval in milliseconds at which the [`onParseProgress`](#onparseprogress) callback is called.  
Default `100`. Set to `0` for unthrottled and synchronous updates.  
Note that updates are fired very often and updating the DOM often may slow down the conversion process.

### `logLevel?`

One of `"error"`, `"warn"`, `"info"`, `"debug"`, `"trace"`.  
Default value: `"info"`, which logs only important information.

### `acknowledgeRemotionLicense?`

Acknowledge the [Remotion License](https://remotion.dev/license) to make the console message disappear.

## Callbacks

Each field also has a callback that allows you to retrieve the value as soon as it is obtained without waiting for the function to resolve.

You do not have to add the field to the [`fields`](#fields) object if you use the callback.  
However, just like with [`fields`](#fields), adding a callback for a [slow field](/docs/media-parser/fast-and-slow) may require reading more of the file.

```tsx twoslash title="Using a callback"
import {parseMedia} from '@remotion/media-parser';

const result = await parseMedia({
  src: 'https://example.com/my-video.mp4',
  onDurationInSeconds: (durationInSeconds) => {
    console.log(durationInSeconds);
  },
  onDimensions: (dimensions) => {
    console.log(dimensions);
  },
});
```
