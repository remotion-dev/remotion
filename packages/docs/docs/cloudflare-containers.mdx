Cloudflare Containers is a new platform in Beta for invoking Docker containers from Cloudflare's Worker functions.  
It requires a paid Workers plan.

See our [demo](https://github.com/remotion-dev/cloudflare-containers-demo) to deploy a Remotion project to Cloudflare Containers.

## Limitations

The above repository is a proof of concept focusing on the integration of Remotion with Cloudflare Containers.  
It is not production-ready and does not consider the following aspects:

- Authentication, queuing or rate limiting is not implemented in this demo.
- Videos are saving to a R2 bucket with a random name.
- No progress is being sent to the client.
- Errors are not propagated to the client.
