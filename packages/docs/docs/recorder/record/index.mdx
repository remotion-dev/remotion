import {RecordingButton} from '../../../components/recorder/RecordButton';

The Recorder ships with its own recording interface.  
From it, you can record a clip and add it as a scene to your project.

If you haven't done so, start the Remotion Recorder:

```tsx
bun start
```

A Vite app will listen on [`http://localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000).  
Open this URL in the browser.  
Give the page access to the webcam and microphone.

## Select the composition

Recordings need to be stored in a subfolder of `public` with the name of the composition ID.  
For example, if you want to record for the composition `my-video`, recordings will be stored under `public/my-video`.

In the top right corner, use the dropdown to "Create a new folder".  
Give it the same name as the ID of the composition you want to record for.  
The folder will be created and your subsequent recordings will be saved in this folder.

## Select sources

In the top left panel, select your webcam and microphone.  
In the top right panel, optionally select the screen you want to record.

You can record more sources, but out of the box, the Remotion Recorder does not do anything with them.

## Before starting

Say "Test One Two Three" and ensure the volume meter is not going into the red zone.

Make sure you are centered in the video. You can enable the crop target overlay to see how the video will crop when miniaturized.

Prefer making short recordings. You're less likely to make a mistake and it's easy to stitch them together.

There is no countdown – The recording will start immediately.  
However, the Recorder will later automatically trim away the silence in the beginning.

Take a deep breath and think of what you are about to say and show.

You're ready to record!

## Start the recording

<div
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'row',
    alignItems: 'center',
    flexWrap: 'wrap',
  }}
>
  <div>
    To start recording, press <kbd>R</kbd> or click{' '}
  </div>
  <RecordingButton type="start" />
  <div>in the top left corner.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'row',
    alignItems: 'center',
    flexWrap: 'wrap',
  }}
>
  <div>Once you are done with the scene, click</div>
  <RecordingButton type="stop" />
  <div>.</div>
</div>

## Selecting a take

After you have recorded a scene and you are happy with your take, click "Use this take".

The server will then do the following:

- Convert the videos from WebM to MP4
- Put them into your project under `public/[composition-id]`.
- Caption the files with Whisper.cpp

## Discard a take

If you have taken a recording that you don't want to use, click "Discard and retake" to clear the existing recording from memory.

## record.remotion.dev

You can also use the hosted version of the recoding interface at [record.remotion.dev](https://record.remotion.dev).

It will not allow you to select a save destination, but instead download the recordings to your `Downloads` folder.

They will have names like `webcam171234567890.mp4` and `display171234567890.mp4`.

To copy the recordings to your Remotion project, first open `copy.ts` in your code editor. Set the `prefix` at the top of your file to the ID of the composition that you gave when you first created a new video.

```ts title="copy.ts"
const prefix = '<id-of-your-composition>';
```

Then run the `copy.ts` script whenever you want to save a take and immediately generate captions:

```bash
bun copy.ts
bun sub.ts
```

If you want to not use a take, just make another recording. The `copy.ts` script will only take the recordings with the latest timestamp.
