# Setup

First, [purchase](/docs/recorder/buy) the Recorder to [get access to the repo](https://github.com/remotion-dev/recorder).

## 1. Fork and clone

[Create a fork](https://github.com/remotion-dev/recorder/fork) of the `remotion-dev/recorder` repository.

:::note
You need to keep your fork **private** to not leak the source code of the Remotion Recorder.
:::

Then, clone your fork to get the project locally.

## 2. Install Bun

The Remotion Recorder requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/). To install it, run

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## 3. Install dependencies

Once bun is installed, run

```bash
bun i
```

to install all the neccessary dependencies.

This is also a good time to initialize Whisper.cpp by installing it and downloading a model:

```bash
bun sub.ts
```
