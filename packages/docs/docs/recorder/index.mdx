The Remotion Recorder is a video production tool <strong>built entirely in JavaScript</strong>.

## Different platforms require different formats

Each platform has its own conventions for how videos should look.

The goal of the Recorder: Edit once <strong>and feel native on each platform</strong>.

## Captions are essential

Generate captions locally using [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp). The Recorder will automatically install it for you.  
AI will make mistakes - so we make it easy to correct them.

<div style={{overflowX: 'auto', WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch', }}>
<table style={{  tableLayout: "fixed", width: 950, marginBottom: 0 }}>  <tr>
    <td valign="top" style={{width: 950/ 3}}>
      <video src="/recorder/wordlevel.webm" autoPlay muted playsInline loop></video>
      Captions have word-level timings
      </td>
    <td valign="top" style={{width: 950/ 3}}>
      <video src="/recorder/noorphans.webm" autoPlay muted playsInline loop></video>
     Orphan words are avoided by balancing the text layout
    </td>
    <td valign="top" style={{width: 950/ 3}}>
      <video src="/recorder/monospace.webm" autoPlay muted playsInline loop></video>
      Use `backticks` to highlight technical terms

## Agnostic endcards

Your viewer watched the entire video! Now don't make them forget about you.

<table style={{ width: 950, tableLayout: "fixed" }}>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" style={{ width: 950 / 2 }}>
      <p align="center" style={{ marginTop: 0, marginBottom: 0 }}>
        <img
          style={{ borderRadius: 5, height: 250 }}
          src="/recorder/endcard-square.png"
          autoPlay
          muted
          playsInline
          loop
        ></img>
      </p>
      If you post on Twitter, the call-to-action is "Follow" and your other platforms
      are linked.
    </td>
    <td valign="top" style={{ width: 950 / 2 }}>
      <img
        style={{ width: 950 / 2, borderRadius: 5 }}
        src="/recorder/endcard-youtube.png"
        autoPlay
        muted
        playsInline
        loop
      ></img>
      <br />
      If you post on YouTube, the call to action is "Subscribe" and cutouts for related
      videos are made.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The endcard is written with React and CSS, so can be easily customized.

## What makes a good video?

### Concise

Value the viewers time by cutting out pauses and bad takes.

The Recorder lets you record many small clips and stitches them together.  
It's easy to discard bad takes and retry immediately.  
Silence at the start and end of your take is automatically removed, so it's not tedious to edit either!

### Engaging

Subtle animations, background music, titles, b-roll footage and effects make your video more interesting.

The Recorder always has an appealing layout that smoothly transitions between scenes, and allows you to add secondary clips over your voiceover.

Use the music that comes with the Recorder or add your own. Volume is lowered automatically when you speak.

### On-brand

Make your video recognizable by giving it a unique characteristic.  
It could be a specific color, a font, or a border around your facecam.

You can fully customize the style of the video with React and CSS.  
You will get the full source code of the Recorder, so you can make it exactly yours.

### Great audio

Having a microphone is only half the battle. Great audio has consistent volume throughout, no clipping, consistent pacing and mixes well with the background music.

The Recorder has a volume meter that tells you when you are too close to the microphone.  
The silence at the start and end of your take is automatically removed and pauses between your clips are consistent.  
A script is included to make all clips of your video have the same volume.

## Features

### Recording

Record your facecam and screen in sync but independently, so you can change the layout later.  
See if you are too loud or off-center.

### Captioning

Automatically transcribes your video using [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) and adds animated captions to it.  
Remap wrongly transcribed words programmatically or manually.  
Animates your captions word-by-word.

### Silence removal

Automatically remove the silence at the start and end of your take.

### Music

Add background music to your video and automatically fade between the different sections.  
Three exclusive tracks are included that you may use for your video.

### Layouting

Whether you only record your facecam, or also your display, the Recorder always finds the ideal layout - even if you mix landscape and portrait videos.

### Transitions

Enable clean transitions between scenes - no matter if you change the layout during the video.

### Chapters

Mark a scene as the beginning of a new chapter and automatically generated animated chapters.

### B-Roll

Add images and videos on top of your facecam or display while your voiceover is playing to give the video more depth.

### Endcard

Automatically generate a platform-agnostic end card with a _follow_ call to action, your other platforms and links.

### Exporting

Export your video with much control over the encoding options.  
Render a video with a single click on a button, the CLI, Node.JS APIs, GitHub Actions, or even on AWS Lambda!

### Themes

The two default themes are light and dark.  
If you plan on embedding the video on a website, you can embed one version for light mode and one for dark mode.

### Customization

The Remotion Recorder ships source code.  
You can customize it to your liking if you have TypeScript and React knowledge.
