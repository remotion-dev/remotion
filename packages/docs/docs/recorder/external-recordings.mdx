You can also include recordings that you recorded externally in your Recorder video.  
For example, you may edit a vlog with it.

## Add files

Transfer the recordings from your camera to your computer and put them in the `public/<composition-id>` folder.  
The file structure should look like this:

```bash title="Assuming the composition id is 'vlog'"
public
├── vlog
│ ├── camera10.mov
│ ├── camera20.mov
│ └── camera30.mov

```

The prefix must be `"webcam"` for every video.  
The suffixes must be ascending in the order you want to use the videos.

## Generate captions

Run

```bash
bun sub.ts
```

to generate captions for your recordings.

## Use the videos

Now you can add more scenes in the right sidebar to start including the recordings.

## Examples

In the [`our-recorder`](https://github.com/remotion-dev/our-recorder) repository, the compositions `marathon` and `airportrun` are using real-life footage.
