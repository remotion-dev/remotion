To generate captions, the Remotion Recorder uses [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) for fast and accurate transcriptions.
Each time you record a clip with the Remotion Recorder, captions are automatically generated and persisted to same folder as your recordings.

## First transcription

The very first time you finish recording a clip, Whisper.cpp and a 1.5GB model will be installed on your computer. This may take a few minutes.
Once installed, captions for the `webcam` clip will be generated.

:::info
Captions are only generated for files with the `webcam` prefix.

## Make corrections

If the AI has made a mistake, no problem, there are various ways to correct the transcriptions manually. [See here how to do this](/docs/recorder/editing/captions).

## Generate captions via CLI

If you want to generate captions for a clip that has not been recorded with the Remotion Recorder, put the files you want to transcribe in the public folder and run:

```
bun sub.ts
```

Note that the names of the files you want to transcribe need to start with the prefix `webcam`, all other files will be ingored.
The JSON files containing the captions will be generated and saved under `public/<composition-id>/sub[timestamp].json`.
