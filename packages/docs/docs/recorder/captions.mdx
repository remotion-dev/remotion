To generate captions, the Remotion Recorder uses [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) for fast and accurate transcriptions.

## Setup

The first time you will run the command below, Whisper.cpp will be installed and a 1.5GB model will be installed on your computer. This may take a few minutes.

## Generate

To generate captions for all of your recordings, run:

```
bun sub.ts
```

JSON files will be generated and saved under `public/<id>/sub[timestamp].json`.

## Make corrections

If the AI has made a mistake, no problem, there are various ways to correct the transcriptions manually. [See here how to do this](/docs/recorder/editing/captions).
