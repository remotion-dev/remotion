When you buy the Remotion Recorder, you will also get access to [`remotion-dev/our-recorder`](https://github.com/remotion-dev/our-recorder).  
This is the instance of the Recorder that is being used to create [Jonnys](https://twitter.com/JNYBGR) and [Remotion](https://twitter.com/remotion)'s videos.

This repository may have more and newer features, but it is not guaranteed to be stable.  
Use it as a reference if you wonder how we made a specific video!
