Here is a list of things that we plan to add.  

## âœ… SRT export

The convention on YouTube is to provide subtitles in the form of an `.srt` file instead of burning them in.  
We plan to add this as a Remotion feature and then enable it in the Recorder.

## 9:16 format

We plan to support a new format that makes the videos feel native on Instagram, YouTube Shorts and TikTok.

- Different layout for webcam and display
- Word-by-word captions
- Animating the captions

## Improving the editing experience

We plan to add new Remotion APIs and Remotion Studio features to make edits easier than having to use the props editor.

## Give us feedback

Let us know on the [`#recorder`](https://remotion.dev/recorder) channel what you would like to see next.
