### Title Scene

A title consists of the main title and an optional subtitle.
The subtitle can be removed by checking the `null` checkbox in the right side.

### Camera Scene

A camera scene contains a webcam recording, an optional screencast and captions, if [generated](/captions/generate). Each recording captured with the recorder corresponds to one camera scene.
For each newly added camera scene, the chronologically next recording will be added to the timeline.

The webcam can be positioned in either one of the four corners of the video. The other components will be automatically positioned around the webcam.

### Endcard

In the endcard you can add call to actions, such as links to your social media profiles or other websites.
