# Endcard

In the endcard you can add call to actions, such as links to your social media profiles or other websites.
This can be setup in the `remotion/configuration.tsx` file by adding your information as `Channel` object.

```tsx filename="Example configuration.tsx"
export const channels: {
  [key in Channel]: ChannelConfig & {
    isLinkedInBusinessPage: boolean;
  };
} = {
  jonny: {
    instagram: null,
    linkedin: "Jonny Burger",
    x: "@JNYBGR",
    youtube: "/JonnyBurger",
    discord: null,
    isLinkedInBusinessPage: false,
  },
  remotion: {
    instagram: "@remotion",
    linkedin: "Remotion",
    x: "@remotion",
    youtube: "@remotion_dev",
    discord: null,
    isLinkedInBusinessPage: true,
  },
};
```
