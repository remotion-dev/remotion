To start the editing environment, run

```
bun start
```

This will start the development server and open a Remotion Studio instance in a new window.

## Create a new composition

A composition is a video that you can edit and render.

In the left sidebar, create a new composition by right-clicking the `empty` composition and selecting `Duplicate` and give it an ID.  
The ID should be the same as the name of the subfolder of `public` where you store your videos.
**Example**: If you store your recordings in `public/hello-world`, the ID should be `hello-world`.

## Add new scenes to the composition

Open the right sidebar. By default there are no scenes.  
Click the `+` button to add a new scene.

<img style={{ width: 300 }} src="/recorder/add-scene.png" />

By default, it will add a video scene, which will consume the first recording in the `public/[composition-id]` folder.

You can also switch the scene type to something different like `endcard` or `title`.  
Each scene type has its own settings which you can configure in the right sidebar.

To save the scenes, click the disk icon or use `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`.
