If you haven't done so yet, start the Recorder:

```bash
bun start
```

Remotion calls each output video a "Composition". There are two ways to generate a new composition:

## 1. Visual way

Open [`http://localhost:3000`](https://localhost:3000) and in the left sidebar, right-click on the "empty" composition. Select "Duplicate" and give your composition an ID. Confirm.

## 2. Manual way

Open the project in a code editor. You will see an empty [`<Composition>`](/docs/terminology/composition) under `remotion/Root.tsx`:

```tsx
<Composition
  component={Main}
  id="empty"
  schema={videoConf}
  defaultProps={{
    theme: "light" as const,
    canvasLayout: "square" as const,
    scenes: [],
    scenesAndMetadata: [],
    platform: "x" as const,
  }}
  calculateMetadata={calcMetadata}
/>
```

Copy and paste the [`<Composition />`](/docs/composition) component to duplicate it and give it an [`id`](/docs/terminology/composition#composition-id) that is different than `"empty"`. For example:

```tsx title="remotion/Root.tsx"
<Composition
  component={Main}
  id="empty"
  schema={videoConf}
  defaultProps={{
    theme: "light" as const,
    canvasLayout: "square" as const,
    scenes: [],
    scenesAndMetadata: [],
  }}
  calculateMetadata={calcMetadata}
/>
<Composition
  component={Main}
  id="my-video"
  schema={videoConf}
  defaultProps={{
    theme: "light" as const,
    canvasLayout: "square" as const,
    scenes: [],
    scenesAndMetadata: [],
  }}
  calculateMetadata={calcMetadata}
/>
```

Save, and you should see the new composition when you look at the Remotion Studio on [`http://localhost:3000`](https://localhost:3000).
