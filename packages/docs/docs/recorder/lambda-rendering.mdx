If you want to render long videos faster or you want to render different versions of your videos at the same time, you can take advantage of [@remotion/lambda](/docs/lambda).

## Setup Lambda

First you need to set up [Remotion Lambda](/docs/lambda).  
Follow steps 1-7 of the instructions shown [here](/docs/lambda/setup).

## Deploy and render

:::note
Your site will get a URL that is publicly accessible. Make sure to keep it private and do not share it with anyone.
:::

Add the following function and site deployment commands as well as the render command into a shell script you can execute each time you want to render a video:

```shell
bunx remotion lambda functions deploy --memory=3009
bunx remotion lambda sites create --site-name=remotion-recorder --enable-folder-expiry
bunx remotion lambda render remotion-recorder <composition-id> --delete-after="7-days"
```

Explanation:

1. [Deploy](/docs/lambda/cli/functions#deploy) a Lambda function. Setting memory to 3009MB will give you [3 vCPUs](/docs/lambda/runtime#core-count--vcpus). If the function already exists, nothing will happen, therefore it is safe to run the command every time.
2. [Upload](/docs/lambda/cli/sites#create) the Recorder and your Recordings to S3. Give the site the name `remotion-recorder`, you may choose a different name if you like. The [`--enable-folder-expiry`](/docs/lambda/cli/sites#--enable-folder-expiry) flag will make it possible to render videos that automatically delete. If a site with this name already existed, it will update it.
3. [Render](/docs/lambda/cli/render) the video. Pass the site name and [composition ID](/docs/terminology/composition#composition-id) to the command. The [`--delete-after`](/docs/lambda/cli/render#--delete-after) flag will delete the video after the specified time, you may remove this flag if you want to keep the video.

## Rendering for a specific platform

You may use [`--props`](/docs/lambda/cli/render#--props) to override the default props that you set in your composition.  
Here is a script to render a video for all platforms:

```shell
bunx remotion lambda render --props='{"platform": "youtube", "layout": "landscape"}' remotion-recorder <composition-id>
bunx remotion lambda render --props='{"platform": "x", "layout": "square"}' remotion-recorder <composition-id>
bunx remotion lambda render --props='{"platform": "linkedin", "layout": "square"}' remotion-recorder <composition-id>
```

## Our script

For rendering our videos, we create a TypeScript file and run it with `bun lambda.ts`.

```tsx title="lambda.ts"
import { $ } from "bun";

const siteName = "our-recorder";
const compositionId = "installwhispercpp";

const configs = [
  {
    canvasLayout: "square",
    platform: "linkedin",
  },
  {
    canvasLayout: "square",
    platform: "x",
  },
  {
    canvasLayout: "landscape",
    platform: "youtube",
  },
];

await $`bunx remotion lambda sites create --site-name=${siteName}`;

for (const config of configs) {
  await $`bunx remotion lambda render ${siteName} ${compositionId} --props='${JSON.stringify(config)}'`;
}
```
