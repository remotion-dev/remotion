:::note
This is documentation for the upcoming new `<Audio>` tag.  
Not to be confused with the older [`<Audio>`](/docs/audio) tag from `remotion`.
:::

:::warning
**Experimental**: This component is in an early stage and not yet feature complete.
We recommend that you use [`<Audio />`](/docs/audio) for now.

See the [progress of this component on our issue tracker](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/issues/5650).
:::

This component imports and displays a video, similar to [`<Audio />`](/docs/audio) from `remotion` but during rendering, extracts the exact audio using [Mediabunny](/docs/mediabunny) instead of FFmpeg.

## Example

```tsx twoslash
import {AbsoluteFill, staticFile} from 'remotion';
import {Audio} from '@remotion/media';

export const MyVideo = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Audio src={staticFile('audio.mp3')} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

You can load a video from an URL as well:

```tsx twoslash
import {AbsoluteFill} from 'remotion';
import {Audio} from '@remotion/media';
// ---cut---
export const MyComposition = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Audio src="https://remotion.media/audio.wav" />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

## Props

### `src`

The URL of the audio to be rendered. Can be a remote URL or a local file referenced with [`staticFile()`](/docs/staticfile).

### `trimBefore?`

Will remove a portion of the audio at the beginning (left side).

In the following example, we assume that the [`fps`](/docs/composition#fps) of the composition is `30`.

By passing `trimBefore={60}`, the playback starts immediately, but with the first 2 seconds of the audio trimmed away.  
By passing `trimAfter={120}`, any audio after the 4 second mark in the file will be trimmed away.

The audio will play the range from `00:02:00` to `00:04:00`, meaning the audio will play for 2 seconds.

For exact behavior, see: [Order of operations](/docs/audio/order-of-operations).

```tsx twoslash
import {AbsoluteFill, staticFile} from 'remotion';
import {Audio} from '@remotion/media';

// ---cut---
export const MyComposition = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Audio src={staticFile('audio.mp3')} trimBefore={60} trimAfter={120} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

### `trimAfter?`

Removes a portion of the audio at the end (right side). See [`trimBefore`](#trimbefore) for an explanation.

### `volume?`

Allows you to control the volume of the audio in it's entirety or frame by frame.  
Read the page on [using audio](/docs/using-audio) to learn more.

```tsx twoslash title="Setting a static volume"
import {AbsoluteFill, staticFile} from 'remotion';
import {Audio} from '@remotion/media';

export const MyVideo = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Audio volume={0.5} src={staticFile('background.mp3')} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

```tsx twoslash title="Changing the volume over time"
import {AbsoluteFill, interpolate, staticFile} from 'remotion';
import {Audio} from '@remotion/media';

export const MyVideo = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Audio volume={(f) => interpolate(f, [0, 30], [0, 1], {extrapolateLeft: 'clamp'})} src={staticFile('voice.mp3')} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

### `name?`

A name and that will be shown as the label of the sequence in the timeline of the Remotion Studio. This property is purely for helping you keep track of items in the timeline.

### `onError?`

**Currently not supported!**

### `playbackRate?`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.354" />

Controls the speed of the audio. `1` is the default and means regular speed, `0.5` slows down the audio so it's twice as long and `2` speeds up the audio so it's twice as fast.

```tsx twoslash title="Example of a audio playing twice as fast"
import {AbsoluteFill, staticFile} from 'remotion';
import {Audio} from '@remotion/media';

// ---cut---
export const MyComposition = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Audio playbackRate={2} src={'https://remotion.media/audio.mp3'} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

:::note
Playing a audio in reverse is not supported.
:::

### `loop?`<AvailableFrom v="3.2.29" />

Makes the audio loop indefinitely.

```tsx twoslash title="Example of a looped audio"
import {Audio} from '@remotion/media';

// ---cut---
export const MyComposition = () => {
  return <Audio loop src="https://remotion.media/audio.wav" />;
};
```

### `loopVolumeCurveBehavior?`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.354" />

Controls the `frame` which is returned when using the [`volume`](#volume) callback function and adding the [`loop`](#loop) attribute.

Can be either `"repeat"` (default, start from 0 on each iteration) or `"extend"` (keep increasing frames).

### `muted?`

The `muted` prop will be respected. It will lead to no audio being played while still keeping the audio tag mounted. It's value may change over time, for example to only mute a certain section of the audio.

```tsx twoslash title="Example of a muted video"
import {Audio} from '@remotion/media';
// ---cut---
export const MyComposition = () => {
  return <Audio muted src="https://remotion.media/audio.wav" />;
};
```

### `pauseWhenBuffering?`

If set to `true` and the audio is loading, the Player will enter into the [native buffering state](/docs/player/buffer-state). The default is `false`, but will become `true` in Remotion 5.0.

### `showInTimeline?`

If set to `false`, no layer will be shown in the timeline of the Remotion Studio. The default is `true`.

### `delayRenderTimeoutInMilliseconds?`

Customize the [timeout](/docs/delay-render#modifying-the-timeout) of the [`delayRender()`](/docs/delay-render) call that this component makes.

### `delayRenderRetries?`

Customize the [number of retries](/docs/delay-render#retrying) of the [`delayRender()`](/docs/delay-render) call that this component makes.

### `audioStreamIndex?`

Select the audio stream to use. The default is `0`.

```tsx twoslash
import {AbsoluteFill} from 'remotion';
import {Audio} from '@remotion/media';

// ---cut---
export const MyComposition = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Audio audioStreamIndex={1} src={'https://remotion.media/multiple-audio-streams.mov'} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

### `toneFrequency?`

Accepts a number between `0.01` and `2`, where `1` represents the original pitch. Values less than `1` will decrease the pitch, while values greater than `1` will increase it.

A `toneFrequency` of 0.5 would lower the pitch by half, and a `toneFrequency` of `1.5` would increase the pitch by 50%.

The value must stay the same across the entire time the video tag is mounted.

### `fallbackHtml5AudioProps?`

When a [fallback to `<Audio>` from `remotion`](/docs/media/fallback) happens, this prop allows you to pass props to the fallback `<Audio>` component.  
Only props that are not supported by `<Audio>` from `@remotion/media` need to be specified here - props that apply for both tags will automatically be forwarded and do not need to be specified here.

#### `onError?`

Maps to [`<Audio />` -> `onError`](/docs/audio#onerror)

#### `useWebAudioApi?`

Maps to [`<Audio />` -> `useWebAudioApi`](/docs/audio#usewebaudioapi)

#### `acceptableTimeShiftInSeconds?`

Maps to [`<Audio />` -> `acceptableTimeShiftInSeconds`](/docs/audio#acceptabletimeshiftinseconds)

### `disallowFallbackToHtml5Audio?`<AvailableFrom v="3.0.356" />

By default, if the video cannot be embedded using this tag, [a fallback to `<Audio>` from `remotion`](/docs/media/fallback) will be attempted.

Pass this prop to disable the fallback and fail the render instead.
