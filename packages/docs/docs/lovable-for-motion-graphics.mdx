A common question is whether the next step for Remotion is to build a consumer tool that allows for prompting motion graphics.  
The answer is no! We're building video tech and are encouraging others (you!) to build consumer tools.

## We are not good at B2C

Building a consumer product requires you to build landing pages that convert, launch marketing campaigns, optimize the conversion funnel and provide support at a larger scale.

We're not good at any of these things - our strength is building out video technology that happens to be a great backbone for others who are building products.

## Anyone can license our tech

A lot of companies have already licensed our tech through our [company license](https://www.remotion.pro/license) and are building a variety of products: Video editors, prompt-to-video tools, ad generators and more.

So, a lot of people are already building consumer tools using Remotion and are pushing way faster than we ever could.

We are happy to provide them rather than competing with them. Our incentives are aligned - if they win, we win too.  
If you believe in an idea that can be built with Remotion - we're supporting you fully!

## Being the backbone is great

Let's take an example from another industry: Since AI, a lot of code review products have launched: CodeRabbit, Cursor, Copilot Review, Greptile and dozens more.  
The competition is fierce and the business is tough! But, the providers of the AI backbone are winning because many tools are built on top of them.

Going deeper: In a world where companies race to create the best AI model, the biggest winner is NVIDIA being the backbone.

## Building software that composes

In addition to this just not being our strength, there is also another aspect that any builder should think about.

A lot of people enjoy using Remotion with Claude Code.

While on the surface, it looks like a simple chat interface, there is a lot of work done by Anthropic to make it work as well as it does (permission modes, subagents, tools, skills, ability to run multiple sessions) and a big reason why it works great is that it integrates well with the OS (leveraging UNIX utilities, the command line, the file system).

It's not a coincidence that people love using Claude Code way more than using an AI integrated into another product.

We believe that if we were to spend a lot of effort building our own chat interface, we're still going to end up with a tool that is not as good as Claude Code all while people just wanna use Claude Code badly.

With excellent execution, Lovable for motion graphics will be great - but with the DNA of our company being to try to create something big with little resources, it's not for us.
