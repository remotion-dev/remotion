Some types of content in Remotion can benefit from a GPU being available on the machine that is used for rendering.  
By default in many cases, the GPU is disabled in headless mode, which can lead to a significant slowdown in rendering time.

## Content accelerated by the GPU

- WebGL content (Three.JS, Skia, P5.js, Mapbox etc.)
- `box-shadow`
- `text-shadow`
- `background-image: linear-gradient()`
- `background-image: radial-gradient()`
- `filter: blur()`
- `filter: drop-shadow()`
- `transform`
- Many 2D Canvas operations

If a GPU is available, it should be enabled by default while in the Remotion Studio or Remotion Player.  
However, in headless mode, Chromium disables the GPU, leading to a significant
slowdown in rendering time.

## Content not accelerated by the GPU

Contrary to popular belief, the following content is not accelerated by the GPU:

- `<Video>`
- `<OffthreadVideo>`
- [Canvas pixel manipulation](/docs/video-manipulation)

Furthermore, the encoding of the video is not accelerated by the GPU at this point.

## Use the `--gl` flag to enable the GPU during rendering

See [here](/docs/gl-options) for recommendations which OpenGL backend you should use during rendering.

## GPU for server-side rendering

[See here](/docs/miscellaneous/cloud-gpu) for an example on how to use the GPU during server-side rendering.

## Using the GPU on Lambda

AWS Lambda instances have no GPU, so it is not possible to use it.

## What are your experiences?

We'd love to learn and document more findings about the GPU. Let us know and we will amend this document!
