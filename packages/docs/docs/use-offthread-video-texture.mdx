_available from v4.0.83_

Allows you to use a video in React Three Fiber that is synchronized with Remotion's `useCurrentFrame()`, similar to [`useVideoTexture()`](/docs/use-video-texture), but uses [`<OffthreadVideo>`](/docs/offthreadvideo) instead.

This hook only works during rendering. In the Player and the Remotion Studio, use [`useVideoTexture()`](/docs/use-video-texture) instead. See below for an example.

This hook was designed to combat limitations of the default `<Video>` element that is used with `useVideoTexture()` hook.
See: [`<OffthreadVideo> vs <Video>`](/docs/video-vs-offthreadvideo)

The return type of it is a `THREE.Texture | null` which you can assign as a `map` to for example `meshBasicMaterial`. We recommend to only render the material when the texture is not `null` to prevent bugs.

## Example

```tsx twoslash title="Simple usage (only works during rendering)"
import {ThreeCanvas, useOffthreadVideoTexture} from '@remotion/three';
import {staticFile, useVideoConfig} from 'remotion';

const videoSrc = staticFile('/vid.mp4');

const My3DVideo = () => {
  const {width, height} = useVideoConfig();

  const videoTexture = useOffthreadVideoTexture({src: videoSrc});

  return (
    <ThreeCanvas width={width} height={height}>
      <mesh>{videoTexture ? <meshBasicMaterial map={videoTexture} /> : null}</mesh>
    </ThreeCanvas>
  );
};
```

```tsx twoslash title="Use useVideoTexture() only during rendering"
import {ThreeCanvas, useOffthreadVideoTexture, useVideoTexture} from '@remotion/three';
import {useRef} from 'react';
import {getRemotionEnvironment, staticFile, useVideoConfig, Video} from 'remotion';

const videoSrc = staticFile('/vid.mp4');

const useVideoOrOffthreadVideoTexture = (videoSrc: string, videoRef: React.RefObject<HTMLVideoElement | null>) => {
  if (getRemotionEnvironment().isRendering) {
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/rules-of-hooks
    return useOffthreadVideoTexture({src: videoSrc});
  }

  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/rules-of-hooks
  return useVideoTexture(videoRef);
};

const My3DVideo = () => {
  const {width, height} = useVideoConfig();

  const videoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement | null>(null);
  const videoTexture = useVideoOrOffthreadVideoTexture(videoSrc, videoRef);

  return (
    <>
      {getRemotionEnvironment().isRendering ? null : <Video ref={videoRef} src={videoSrc} style={{position: 'absolute', opacity: 0}} />}
      <ThreeCanvas width={width} height={height}>
        <mesh>{videoTexture ? <meshBasicMaterial map={videoTexture} /> : null}</mesh>
      </ThreeCanvas>
    </>
  );
};
```

## API

Takes an object with the following properties:

### `src`

The video source. Can be a URL or a [`staticFile()`](/docs/staticfile).

### `playbackRate`

The playback rate of the video. Defaults to `1`.

:::note
Playing a video in reverse is not supported.
:::

### `transparent`

_optional, boolean_

If set to `true`, frames will be extracted as PNG, enabling transparency but also slowing down your render.

If set to `false` (_default_), frames will be extracted as bitmap (BMP), which is faster.

### `toneMapped`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.117" />

Since Remotion 4.0.117, Remotion will adjust the colors of videos in different color spaces (such as HDR) when converting to RGB, to counteract color shifts.  
Since the browser is painting in sRGB, this is necessary to ensure that the colors are displayed correctly.  
This behavior is by default `true` and can be disabled by setting `toneMapped` to `false`.  
Disabling tone mapping will speed up rendering, but may result in less vibrant colors.

Prior to Remotion 4.0.117, tone mapping was always disabled, and the `toneMapped` prop was not available.

### `delayRenderTimeoutInMilliseconds`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.271" />

Customize the [timeout](/docs/delay-render#modifying-the-timeout) of the [`delayRender()`](/docs/delay-render) call that this hook makes.

### `delayRenderRetries`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.271" />

Customize the [number of retries](/docs/delay-render#retrying) of the [`delayRender()`](/docs/delay-render) call that this hook makes.

## Looping a texture

Like `<OffthreadVideo>`, looping a video [is not supported out of the box](/docs/offthreadvideo#looping-a-offthreadvideo) but can be achieved with the `<Loop>` component.
