import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

The easiest way to do this is to run the following command in the root of your project:

<Tabs
defaultValue="npx"
values={[
{ label: 'npx', value: 'npx', },
{ label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm', },
{ label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
{ label: 'bunx', value: 'bunx', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="npx">

```bash
npx remotion upgrade
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm exec remotion upgrade
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn remotion upgrade
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="bunx">

```bash
bunx remotion upgrade
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
You need the `@remotion/cli` package installed for this.

## Breaking changes

Remotion follows semantic versioning.  
This means if the first number of the version is the same, you can upgrade and your code is backwards-compatible.

Example: If you are on 4.0.0, you can upgrade to 4.1.100 without changing your code.  
However, to upgrade to 5.0, you will need to follow the [migration guide](/docs/5-0-migration).

Exceptions to the breaking change rule are APIs that are marked as experimental.
