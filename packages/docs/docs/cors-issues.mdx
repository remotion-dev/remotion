title: How to debug any CORS issue
crumb: '#@!*'

A CORS issue is best debugged with Google Chrome because of the useful error messages.  
Upon a CORS failure, an error message is printed to the console, explaining why the request has been blocked:

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>`Access to fetch at 'https://google.com/' from origin 'https://remotion.dev' has been blocked by CORS policy:` </span>
<br />
`No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.`

**The secret to debugging CORS errors is to read the error message carefully.**

In this case, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is missing.  
You can resolve the error by sending the following header from your server:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

In other scenarios, the error message might be different!

## Watch out for Preflight requests

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>`Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:3005/' from origin 'http://localhost:3001' has been blocked by CORS policy:`</span>
<br />
`Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.`

For some HTTP methods, the browser will send a request with the method `OPTIONS` first.  
This is called a preflight request.

| HTTP Method                 | OPTIONS Request Sent? |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| GET, HEAD                   | No                    |
| POST                        | Sometimes\*           |
| PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS | Yes                   |

<details>
  <summary>When a POST request sends a preflight request</summary>
  <p>POST requests do not trigger a preflight request unless they include custom headers or have a Content-Type other than `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data` or `text/plain`.</p>
  <p>
    Common gotcha: Adding the <code>Content-Type: application/json</code> header to a POST request will cause it to trigger a preflight request!
  </p>
</details>

The solution for these errors is to **also return the CORS headers in the response to the `OPTIONS` request.**

Notice how the error message explicitly mentions the "preflight request"!

## Set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>`Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:3005/' from origin 'http://localhost:3001' has been blocked by CORS policy:`</span>
<br />
`Method PUT is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Methods in preflight response.`

If a [preflight](#watch-out-for-preflight-requests) request is happening, the response also must include the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header.

Add the following header to the response:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: *
```

If you intend to use HTTP methods other than `GET`, `HEAD` or `POST`, you should always add the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header.

Again, notice that the error message was very specific!

## Requesting localhost URLs

Sometimes a request cannot be made not because a website on the internet requests a `localhost` URL:

<span style={{opacity: 0.5}}>`Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:3005/' from origin 'https://www.remotion.dev' has been blocked by CORS policy:`</span>
<br />
`Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network' header was present in the preflight response for this private network request targeting the "local" address space.`

This issue can be solved by adding the `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network` header to the response:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true`

## Solving any CORS error

There are more headers which can come into play:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network`
- `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
- `Access-Control-Max-Age`

Whatever the issue, the error message in Chrome is very specific!  
Read the error message carefully and act appropriately.

## Disable the cache

If nothing makes sense, maybe it is a cache issue!  
Open the Chrome DevTools and in the Network tab, check "Disable cache".
