[On September 1st 2025, we announced](/blog/mediabunny) that we are combining our efforts and are helping Mediabunny become the definitive multimedia library for the web!

As a result, we will be slowing phasing out [`@remotion/media-parser`](/docs/media-parser) and [`@remotion/webcodecs`](/docs/webcodecs) and deprecate it when Mediabunny has reached the same capabilities.

## Should I use Mediabunny or Media Parser?

For new projects, we recommend that you [try out Mediabunny](https://mediabunny.dev/guide/quick-start).

You can continue to use Media Parser in existing projects. Media Parser is not yet deprecated.  
We have not yet published any material for how to migrate from Media Parser to Mediabunny, but we will slowly create it and update our documentation.

## Differences in features

Some features are available in Media Parser but not (yet) in Mediabunny, and vice versa.  
Here are some notable ones:

**Features exclusive to Media Parser**:

- `.ts`, `.m3u8`, and `.avi` container support
- Foreign file probing

**Features exclusive to Mediabunny**:

- `.ogg`, `.adts` container support
- Compression
- Media Player
- Video creation
- Live recording and streaming
- Tree shaking

Mediabunny is generally faster.  
Media Parser has higher-level APIs ("`extractFrames()`") while Mediabunny's API is lower-level.  
Mediabunny has a more permissive license (see below).

If one of these characteristics is important for you, let this influence your choice.

## How are Remotion and Mediabunny related?

Mediabunny is an independent project by [Vanilagy](https://github.com/vanilagy).  
Remotion is a Gold Sponsor of Mediabunny.

## Reporting bugs

If you can pin down an issue to the Mediabunny library directly, then report an issue under [Mediabunny's repo](https://github.com/vanilagy/mediabunny/issues).  
If an issue also concerns Remotion usage described in our docs, you can file it within the [Remotion repo](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/issues).

## License

Remotion (the framework), `@remotion/media-parser` and `@remotion/webcodecs` continue to use the [Remotion License](/docs/license).
If you are using Remotion and are not eligible for the Free License, you continue to require a Company License.

[Mediabunny](https://mediabunny.dev) has a more permissive MPL 2.0 license.  
If you are a company and you are only interested in the multimedia library, you don't need a Company License to use Mediabunny - it is truly open source!

## What happens with remotion.dev/convert?

It's not yet clear, but we both want to have a video conversion website that works fully offline, uses hardware acceleration and has no ads.
