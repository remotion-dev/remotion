We are making new [`<Video>`](/docs/media/video) and [`<Audio>`](/docs/media/audio) tags for Remotion.  
Our goal is to create a new default for embedding videos and audio into your Remotion that is best-in-class:

- absolute frame-accuracy
- fastest
- minimal data fetching

## Renaming old `<Video>` and `<Audio>` tags

We want the tags that are called `<Video>` and `<Audio>` to be the best choice for users, because users will reach for those first.

Therefore, we are renaming the old tags:

- `<Video>` from `remotion` → [`<Html5Video>`](/docs/html5-video)
- `<Audio>` from `remotion` → [`<Html5Audio>`](/docs/html5-audio)

This reflects the fact that the new tags are based on the HTML5 `<video>` and `<audio>` tags.

## Which tag am I using?

The old tags are imported from the [`remotion`](/docs/remotion) package, the new tags are imported from the [`@remotion/media`](/docs/media) package.

## Why are we renaming the tags?

Users and AIs are intuitively going to reach for `<Video>` and `<Audio>` first, because they are the easiest to find.  
Because of this, we want to make sure the best default is the one that is easiest to find.

## Should I migrate to `@remotion/media`?

Currently, our recommendation is still to use [`<OffthreadVideo>`](/docs/offthreadvideo) for videos and [`<Html5Audio>`](/docs/html5-audio) for audio.  
`@remotion/media` is still experimental, but once it is stable, we will recommend it as the default.
