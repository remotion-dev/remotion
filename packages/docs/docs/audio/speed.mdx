# Controlling playback speed<AvailableFrom v="2.2" />

You can use the [`playbackRate`](/docs/html5-audio#playbackrate) prop to control the speed of the audio.

- `1` is the default.
- `0.5` slows down the audio so it's twice as long
- `2` speeds up the audio so it's twice as fast
- Google Chrome supports playback rates between `0.0625` and `16`.

```tsx twoslash {6} title="MyComp.tsx"
import {AbsoluteFill, Html5Audio, staticFile} from 'remotion';

export const MyComposition = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Html5Audio src={staticFile('audio.mp3')} playbackRate={2} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```
