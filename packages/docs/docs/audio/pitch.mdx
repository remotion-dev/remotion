:::warning
Pitch correction is currently only applied during rendering.
:::

You can use the [`toneFrequency`](/docs/html5-audio#tonefrequency) prop to control the pitch of the audio during rendering.

Values between `0.01` and `2` are accepted, where `1` represents the original pitch. Values less than `1` will decrease the pitch, while values greater than `1` will increase it.

A [`toneFrequency`](/docs/html5-audio#tonefrequency) of 0.5 would lower the pitch by half, and a [`toneFrequency`](/docs/html5-audio#tonefrequency) of `1.5` would increase the pitch by 50%.

```tsx twoslash {7} title="MyComp.tsx"
import {Html5Audio, staticFile, AbsoluteFill} from 'remotion';

export const MyComposition = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <div>Hello World!</div>
      <Html5Audio src={staticFile('audio.mp3')} toneFrequency={0.8} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```
