There are two types of snapping in the Editor Starter:

- Timeline snapping
- Canvas snapping

## Enabling snapping

There is a magnet icon in the toolbar that allows you to enable and disable snapping.  
By default, this toggle is for both timeline and canvas snapping.

Also, there are 2 feature flags to toggle the features globally:

- [`FEATURE_TIMELINE_SNAPPING`](/docs/editor-starter/features#timeline-snapping)
- [`FEATURE_CANVAS_SNAPPING`](/docs/editor-starter/features#canvas-snapping)

There is a keyboard shortcut to toggle snapping: <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>.  
To toggle it, there is another feature flag:

- [`FEATURE_SNAPPING_SHORTCUT`](/docs/editor-starter/features#snapping-toggle-shortcut)

## Timeline snapping

When timeline snapping is enabled, items in the timeline will snap to other items when dragging them.

## Canvas snapping

When canvas snapping is enabled, items in the canvas will snap to the edges of the canvas, or the center of the canvas, both horizontally and vertically.

## Multiple items

Both timeline and canvas snapping works also when multiple items are selected.
