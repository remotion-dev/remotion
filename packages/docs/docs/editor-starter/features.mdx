## Feature flags

Many features are behind feature flags, which can be enabled or disabled by switching the flags in [`src/editor/flags.ts`](https://github.com/remotion-dev/editor-starter/blob/main/src/editor/flags.ts).

Feature flags are useful:

- To disable features you don't need
- To search the codebase for them and find where a feature is implemented
- To understand which features you are adopting for your own project

On this page; if a feature has a flag, you can click on it to see the usages in the codebase. The links for the feature flags will only work if you have bought the Editor Starter (i.e., you have access to the repository) and are logged into GitHub.
