## Is this a video editor?

This is a starting point for building a video editor containing the essential features - it is meant to jumpstart someone else's mission of building a video editor!

## When should I buy the Editor Starter?

If you do not want to start building a video editor from scratch, then consider buying the Editor Starter.

Read the [Before you buy](/docs/editor-starter/before-you-buy) section and make sure the answer to every question is "yes".

We think the Editor Starter is a great choice for starting your video editor, but there are other options that involve Remotion as well:  
You can also [build a video editor from scratch with Remotion](/docs/building-a-timeline), or buy another [Remotion-based video editor](/docs/buy-a-video-editor).

## Do I still need to obtain a Remotion Company License if I buy the Editor Starter?

Since the Editor Starter uses Remotion, you still need to obey by the [Remotion License](/docs/license).

In short: Teams and companies with a headcount of 4 or more need to obtain a [Remotion Company License](https://remotion.pro/license) - read the license for more information.

## Can I integrate the Editor Starter into my existing app?

You should be able to copy one folder into your existing React project and get the frontend parts of the Editor Starter working out of the box.

We assume the most popular stack: React 19, TypeScript, TailwindCSS.

A few framework-specific backend endpoints are required.  
The template itself is a React Router 7 project.  
We also provide copy-pasteable backend endpoints for Next.js.

Read the [Setup](/docs/editor-starter/setup) and [Dependencies](/docs/editor-starter/dependencies) sections to get a better idea of how to integrate the Editor Starter into your existing project.

## Feature X is missing, can you add it?

Don't assume that we will add features, even crucial ones, to the Editor Starter that are not listed in the [Features](/docs/editor-starter/features) section.  
Especially if the feature is listed on the [Features not included](/docs/editor-starter/features-not-included) page.

That being said, we do plan to maintain and enhance the Editor Starter where it makes sense.

## Should I buy the Timeline component or the Editor Starter?

The [Timeline](/docs/timeline) component is good if you are just requiring a timeline and would like to build the rest around it.

The Editor Starter also has a timeline, but also more features that are good to have in a video editor:

- Zoomable Canvas
- Captioning
- Exporting
- Asset uploading and local caching
- Font Picker
- Undo Stack

## I have bought the Timeline component, can I upgrade to the Editor Starter?

If you have already bought the [Timeline](/docs/timeline) and also the Editor Starter, you are eligible for a full refund on the Timeline component.

Buy from the same email address and then contact us at [hi@remotion.dev](mailto:hi@remotion.dev) from the email address you used to buy the Timeline.

## Do I have to use Remotion Lambda?

The default template can be deployed in a fully serverless fashion.  
If you want to render on a long-running server, you can modify the architecture to use the Remotion [Server-side rendering](/docs/ssr) APIs:

- Copy the [frontend code](/docs/editor-starter/setup) into your existing project
- For the [backend routes](/docs/editor-starter/backend-routes), implement them in your long-running server. For how to implement the rendering endpoints, you can take the [Render Server](/templates/render-server) as a reference.

## Is Remotion launching its own video editor?

No - we hope to enable developers to launch their own products rather than entering the space ourselves.

### Why not?

From the beginning, we have been focused on solving problems for developers.  
This is our distinct strength and we do not want to distract ourselves away from it.

In order to launch a successful video editor, you need to invest a lot into marketing and communication.  
This is just not our strength, so launching a template allows us focus on our core competency: video technology.
