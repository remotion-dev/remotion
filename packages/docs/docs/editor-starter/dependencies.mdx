The Editor Starter is built in [React 19](https://react.dev/) and [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/).  
The reference implementation is built in [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/) with the goal of being easily portable to other frameworks.  
[Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for styling.

## Captions

OpenAI's [Audio API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text) is used for captioning.  
Captioning is optional, but it is enabled by default and an OpenAI API key is required to use it.

## Asset uploads

[Assets are uploaded by default to AWS S3](/docs/editor-starter/asset-uploads).  
This means that in order for asset uploads to work, an AWS account is required and AWS S3 needs to be set up.

## Rendering

[Remotion Lambda](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda) is used for rendering.  
This means that in order for rendering to work, an AWS account is required and AWS Lambda needs to be set up.

## Google Fonts

Fonts are loaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). No API key is required for this.
