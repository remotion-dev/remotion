State in the [Editor Starter](/docs/editor-starter) is managed with the built-in React state management utilities: [`useState()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) and [`useContext()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext).

<details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>
  <p>The Editor Starter was built in a way that as many different teams can adopt it as easily as possible.</p>

<p>We chose to use React's native state management to keep the starter kit lightweight, minimize external dependencies, and leverage familiar patterns for developers already comfortable with React.</p>

  <p>While the default React state management utilities are controversial for some, any React application can make use of them and developers are most familiar with them.</p>

## Shape

The whole state of the Editor Starter is stored in a single object with the shape defined by the [`EditorState`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aremotion-dev%2Feditor-starter%20type%20EditorState&type=code).

```ts title="src/editor/state/types.ts"
type DeletedAsset = {
  remoteUrl: string | null;
  remoteFileKey: string | null;
  assetId: string;
  statusAtDeletion: AssetState;
};

export type UndoableState = {
  tracks: TrackType[];
  assets: Record<string, EditorStarterAsset>;
  items: Record<string, EditorStarterItem>;
  fps: number;
  compositionWidth: number;
  compositionHeight: number;
  deletedAssets: DeletedAsset[];
};

export type EditorState = {
  undoableState: UndoableState;
  selectedItems: string[];
  textItemEditing: string | null;
  textItemHoverPreview: TextItemHoverPreview | null;
  renderingTasks: RenderingTask[];
  captioningTasks: CaptioningTask[];
  initialized: boolean;
  itemsBeingTrimmed: ItemBeingTrimmed[];
  loop: boolean;
  assetStatus: Record<string, AssetState>;
};
```

- [`undoableState`](#undoable-state) - State that is affected by the undo stack:
  - `tracks`: An array of [timeline tracks](/docs/editor-starter/tracks-items-assets), the last ones are the ones rendered in the back.
  - `assets`: A map of all [assets](/docs/editor-starter/tracks-items-assets) that have been uploaded to the editor.
  - `items`: A map of all [items](/docs/editor-starter/tracks-items-assets) that have been added to the editor.
  - `fps`: The frame rate (kept in state, [but by default no UI is exposed to change it](/docs/editor-starter/features-not-included#multiple-frame-rates)).
  - `compositionWidth`: The width of the canvas.
  - `compositionHeight`: The height of the canvas.
  - `deletedAssets`: An array of assets [that have been deleted](/docs/editor-starter/asset-cleanup).
- `selectedItems`: An array of item IDs that are currently selected.
- `textItemEditing`: The ID of the text item that is currently being edited, if there is one.
- `textItemHoverPreview`: Preview updates of a text item (for example if a font is hovered in the font picker, the text will render temporarily with the font hovered).
- `renderingTasks`: The state of the rendering process.
- `captioningTasks`: The state of captioning process.
- `initialized`: Whether the editor has been initialized, if not initialized, canvas will not be visible.
- `itemsBeingTrimmed`: An array of items that are currently being trimmed, to show an indication of the maximum trim that is possible.
- `loop`: Whether the playback should loop.
- `assetStatus`: A map of asset IDs to their upload status, which can be:
  - `pending-upload`: The asset is currently being uploaded.
  - `uploaded`: The asset has been uploaded successfully.
  - `error`: The asset upload has failed.
  - `in-progress`: The asset has not been uploaded yet.

## Undoable state

State is separated into undoable and non-undoable parts.  
Undoable state is located within the `undoableState` object of the root state.

**Undoable state** might be:

- Position, size and other properties of an item
- Assets and tracks
- Video properties like dimensions and frame rate

**Non-undoable state** might be:

- Asset upload progress and status
- Captioning progress
- Zoom level
- Rendering state
- Selection state

## Contexts

In [`src/editor-context-provider.tsx`](https://github.com/remotion-dev/editor-starter/blob/main/src/editor/context-provider.tsx), you will see a very deeply nested tree of various context providers.

This is intentional and achieves that when updating a portion of the state, only the components that are dependent on that portion of the state will re-render, while the rest of the components will not.

For the best performance, we recommend that you continue to use this pattern in your own application.

## Preventing state updates when nothing has changed

You should prevent an unnecessary state update when nothing has changed.

- This is better for performance
- [This will prevent adding a snapshot to the undo stack, which would lead to clicking the undo button once with no effect](/docs/editor-starter/undo-redo#preventing-unnecessary-additions-to-the-undo-stack)

Throughout the codebase, you will see checks that prevent an unnecessary state update.

```ts title="Preventing an identity change"
export const markAsDragging = (state: EditorState, itemId: string): EditorState => {
  return changeItem(state, itemId, (item) => {
    if (item.isDragging) {
      // The item would not change, so we return the original object
      return item;
    }

    return {
      ...item,
      isDragging: true,
    };
  });
};
```

## Reading the state imperatively

If you only need to access the state upon an interaction, you can use the [`useCurrentStateAsRef()`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aremotion-dev%2Feditor-starter%20const%20useCurrentStateAsRef&type=code) hook.  
It allows you to imperatively access the state when you need it.

You cannot build a reactive UI with it, but is more performant than using a hook that re-renders when the state changes.

For example: A save button that only needs to access the state when the user clicks it.
