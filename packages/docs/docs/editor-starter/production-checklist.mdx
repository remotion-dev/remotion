Ready to launch? Congrats!  
Before shipping your project to production, here are some things you should check.

## Protected endpoints

The [backend routes](/docs/editor-starter/backend-routes) for assets, captions and rendering are not protected by any authentication or rate limit in our template.  
Did you implement the necessary protections to prevent abuse?

## Asset cleanup

By default, deleted assets are not automatically cleaned up.  
Have you implemented [asset cleanup](/docs/editor-starter/asset-cleanup)?

## Lambda checklist

There is a separate [Lambda checklist](/docs/lambda/checklist) for the Remotion Lambda integration.

## Features not included

Did you check the [features not included](/docs/editor-starter/features-not-included) to see if you are missing any important features you need?

## Unintentional features

Did you check the [features](/docs/editor-starter/features) to see if there are any features you are shipping you didn't know about? Disable them if you don't need them.

## Company License

If you are a company that is not eligible for the Free License, did you purchase a [Remotion Company License](/docs/license)?
