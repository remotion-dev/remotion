The Editor Starter implemnts a basic Undo and Redo feature.  
It works by keeping an array of snapshots of the state of the editor in memory.

## Undoable state

State is separated into undoable and non-undoable parts.
Undoable state is located within the `undoableState` object of the root state.

**Undoable state** may be:

- Position, size and other properties of an item
- Track position and arrangement
- Video properties like dimensions and frame rate

**Non-undoable state** may be:

- Asset upload progress
- Zoom level
- Captioning progress
- Clipboard state
- Rendering state
- Selection state

## Undo stack

An undo stack is an array of previous states that is being kept in memory.  
By default, the undo stack holds 50 states.

Whenever updating a state, you should set the `commitToUndoStack` property appropriately to indicate whether the state update should be committed to the undo stack.

Actions that you may not want to add to the undo stack are high-frequency state update like:

- Dragging an item to a new position in the canvas
- Dragging an item to a new position in the timeline
- Trimming an item in the timeline
- Changing a value in the inspector with the slider

In these cases, it is appropriate to only commit to the undo stack once the mouse cursor is released.

## Preventing state changes

You should prevent an unnecessary write to the undo stack when nothing has changed.  
Nothing is written to the undo stack when the identity of the `undoableState` object has not changed.

This may require you to add additional checks to your state update functions to return the same object if nothing has changed.

```ts title="Preventing an identity change"
export const markAsDragging = (state: EditorState, itemId: string): EditorState => {
  return changeItem(state, itemId, (item) => {
    if (item.isDragging) {
      // The item would not change, so we return the original object
      return item;
    }

    return {
      ...item,
      isDragging: true,
    };
  });
};
```

## Undo and Redo interactions

You can undo and redo actions:

- by using the buttons
- the built-in keyboard shortcuts: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> for undo and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd> for redo.

This behavior is controlled by the following [flags](/docs/editor-starter/features):

- [`FEATURE_UNDO_BUTTON`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aremotion-dev%2Feditor-starter%20FEATURE_UNDO_BUTTON&type=code)
- [`FEATURE_REDO_BUTTON`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aremotion-dev%2Feditor-starter%20FEATURE_REDO_BUTTON&type=code)
- [`FEATURE_UNDO_SHORTCUT`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aremotion-dev%2Feditor-starter%20FEATURE_UNDO_SHORTCUT&type=code)
- [`FEATURE_REDO_SHORTCUT`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aremotion-dev%2Feditor-starter%20FEATURE_REDO_SHORTCUT&type=code)
