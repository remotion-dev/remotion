## Updating packages

To use React 19's newest features, you need at least version `4.0.0` of Remotion.

You need to upgrade both `react` and `react-dom`:

```diff
- "react": "18.3.1"
- "react-dom": "18.3.1"
+ "react": "19.0.0"
+ "react-dom": "19.0.0"
```

If you use TypeScript, update to the newest types as well:

```diff
- "@types/react": "18.3.1"
- "@types/react-dom": "18.3.1"
+ "@types/react": "19.0.0"
+ "@types/react-dom": "19.0.0"
```

Run `npm i`, `bun i`, `yarn` or `pnpm i` afterwards, matching your package manager.

## Updated templates

We have updated all [templates](https://remotion.dev/templates) to use React 19 (exception: React Native Skia).  
See the source code of the templates for examples on how to upgrade it to React 19.

## `HTMLRefElement` Type Change

If you have type errors related to React Refs, upgrade to v4.0.236 of Remotion, where we aligned the types with React 19.

## Ecosystem support

Some libraries that are used with Remotion need upgrading.

### `styled-components`

Update to v6.
