Upgrades all Remotion-related packages.

```
npx remotion upgrade
```

## Flags

### `--package-manager`<AvailableFrom v="3.2.33"/>

_optional_

Forces a specific package manager to be used. This is useful if you are using Remotion in a monorepo and you want to upgrade all packages at once. By default, Remotion will auto-detect the package manager.

Acceptable values are `npm`, `yarn` and `pnpm`

### `--version`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.15"/>

Install a specific version. Also enables downgrading to an older version.

## Package manager support

`npm`, `yarn` and `pnpm` are all supported.

## Additional arguments

Any additional arguments you pass to this command will be forwarded as flags to the package manager, before the list of packages.  
Before v4.0.246, additional arguments were ignored.

## Difference to `npm update`, `yarn upgrade`, `pnpm up`

These commands, when executed without arguments will upgrade all dependencies in your project. We recommend against it because you may unintentionally break other parts of your project when you only wanted to upgrade Remotion.
