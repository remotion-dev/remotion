import {TableOfContents} from '../../components/TableOfContents/cli';

## How to use

You can run the CLI by installing `@remotion/cli` and running:

- `npx remotion` inside a npm project
- `yarn remotion` inside a Yarn project
- `pnpm exec remotion` inside a pnpm project.
- `bunx remotion` inside a Bun project

For brevity, in the documentation we always say `npx remotion`.

Inside an npm script, you don't need the `npx` prefix:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "render": "remotion render"
  }
}
```

### Using Bun<AvailableFrom v="4.0.118" />

By default, the `npx remotion` command is being executed using Node.  
Even `bunx remotion` is using Node, unless you add the `--bun` flag.  
To use Bun, replace `remotion` with `remotionb`.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "render": "remotionb render"
  }
}
```

### Using Deno<AvailableFrom v="4.0.227" />

Deno is not supported by Remotion.  
If you like to experiment nonetheless, use `npx remotiond` to run the Deno version of the CLI.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "render": "remotiond render"
  }
}
```

## Commands

The following commands are available - you can always run them using `npx remotion` or even without the `npx` prefix if you put the command inside an npm script.

<TableOfContents />

## Example command

```
npx remotion render --codec=vp8 HelloWorld out/video.webm
```

## Fig.io autocompletion

Install [Fig](https://fig.io) (macOS only) to add Remotion autocomplete to your terminal.  
Type `npx remotion` to start getting suggestions.
