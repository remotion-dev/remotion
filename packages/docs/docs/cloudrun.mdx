Render Remotion videos on [GCP Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run).

import {GcpRegionList} from '../components/cloudrun/regions.tsx';

## When should I use it?

- You are fine with using Google Cloud Platform in one of the [supported regions](/docs/cloudrun/region-selection).

If one of those constraints is a dealbreaker for you, resort to normal [server-side rendering](/docs/ssr).

## How it works

### Deployment

- Any time a new version of Remotion is published by the Remotion team, a new image will be uploaded to a publicly readable artifact registry in GCP.
- When you deploy a new Cloud Run service to your GCP Project, it will by default download the latest image from the repository. If you require a specific version, you can specify that in the command.

### Rendering

- A Cloud Run service and a Cloud Storage bucket are created in GCP.
- A Remotion project gets deployed to a Cloud Storage bucket as a website.
- The Cloud Run service gets invoked and opens the Remotion project.
- The Cloud Run service renders the video or still, and the final file gets uploaded to Cloud Storage and is available for download.

## Architecture

- **Cloud Run service**: Contains the required libraries and binaries for rendering Remotion projects, and is available for invoking behind a URL.
- **Cloud Storage bucket**: Stores the projects, the renders, and render metadata.
- **CLI**: Allows control of the overall architecture from the command line. Is installed by adding `@remotion/cloudrun` to a project.
- **Node.JS API**: Has the same features as the CLI but is easier to use programmatically.

## Setup / Installation

[**See here**](/docs/cloudrun/setup)

## Region selection

The following regions are available for Remotion Cloud Run:

<GcpRegionList />

[**See here for configurations and considerations.**](/docs/cloudrun/region-selection)

## Quotas and Limits

For all up-to-date values, check the [official Cloud Run docs](https://cloud.google.com/run/quotas).

- The maximum memory size is 32gb.
- The maximum number of vCPUs is 8.
- The maximum writeable, in-memory filesystem, limited by instance memory, is 32gb.
- The maximum timeout is 60 minutes.

## Cost

Most of our users render multiple minutes of video for just a few pennies. The exact cost is dependent on the region, assigned memory, type of video and other parameters. You might also need a Remotion license (see below).

## GCP permissions

Remotion Cloud Run requires you to create a GCP project and create a Service Account with some permissions attached to it. We require only the minimal amount of permissions required for operating Remotion Cloud Run. [Service Account permission list and reasons](/docs/cloudrun/permissions).

## CLI

You can control Remotion Cloud Run using the `npx remotion cloudrun` command.

[**Read more about the CLI**](/docs/cloudrun/cli)

## Node.JS API

Everything you can do using the CLI, you can also control using Node.JS APIs. See the reference [here](/docs/cloudrun/api).

## License

The standard Remotion license applies: https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/blob/main/LICENSE.md

Companies needing a license and using cloud rendering must set it up with Cloud Rendering Units. Please visit: https://remotion.pro/license

## Uninstalling

We make it easy to remove all Remotion resources from your GCP project without leaving any traces or causing further costs.
