If you want to build a video editor application quickly, you can purchase pre-built editor templates and components rather than building everything from scratch. Here are the available options:

## Editor Starter by Remotion

A minimal timeline interface component that follows all of Remotion's best practices and recommendations.

**Features:**

- Playhead
- Resizable, moveable layers
- Create and move tracks
- Filmstrip video thumbnails

This is recommended if you need just the timeline functionality and want to build the rest of your editor around it.
