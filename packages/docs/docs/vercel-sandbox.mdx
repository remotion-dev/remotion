title: Rendering with Vercel Sandbox
crumb: 'Server-side rendering'
---

Vercel Sandbox allows you to render videos on-demand without managing Lambda or AWS infrastructure.  
Each render spawns an ephemeral Linux VM with full access to the Remotion renderer.

As a reference implementation, we have created a template: [Next.js Sandbox Template](https://remotion.dev/templates/vercel).

## Getting Started

Use the Vercel template:

```bash
npx create-video@latest --template vercel
```

Push it to Vercel.

Then, in your Vercel dashboard, under "Storage", create a new Blob store and connect it to the project.  
Redeploy for the changes to take effect.

## Advantages

This is the easiest way to setup Remotion server-side rendering. You only need one Vercel account and connect a blob storage - then you just push to deploy.

Vercel has higher limits than Lambda by default, so you can render more videos at once than with a fresh AWS account.

Allowing for 2000 concurrent sandboxes on the Pro Plan allows for massive scale.

## Limitations

Rendering happens on a single machine rather than a distributed system, so it is slower than Lambda.

Spawning a new VM for each render has a setup phase which includes installing dependencies and downloading a browser.  
We plan to soon improve this by using Vercel Sandbox snapshots.

Currently, the browser downloaded does not have support for decoding H.264, meaning that using [`@remotion/media`](/docs/media) will often fallback to [`<OffthreadVideo>`](/docs/offthreadvideo).  
We also plan to resolve this by using a custom build of Chrome soon.

## Limits

The timeout limit for Vercel Sandbox is 45 minutes on the Hobby plan, and 5 hours on the Pro and Enterprise plans.  
For concurrency, the limit is 10 simultaneous renders on Hobby, and 2000 on Pro and Enterprise.
