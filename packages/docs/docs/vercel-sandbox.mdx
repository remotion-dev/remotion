Vercel Sandbox allows you to render videos on-demand without managing Lambda or AWS infrastructure.  
Each render spawns an ephemeral Linux VM with full access to the Remotion renderer.

As a reference implementation, we have created a template: [Next.js Sandbox Template](https://remotion.dev/templates/vercel).

## Getting Started

You can deploy with one-click using the button below:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-description=Render%20your%20Remotion%20videos%20on%20Vercel.&demo-image=%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fe5382hct74si%2F4pq2kfE4t05fMkDCKGsfqz%2F1444f1b559d50391052fdf5102502ac9%2FFlagsmith_Dark.png&demo-title=Remotion%20on%20Vercel&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Ftemplate-vercel.remotion.dev%2F&from=templates&products=%255B%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522blob%2522%257D%255D&project-name=Remotion%20on%20Vercel&project-names=Comma%20separated%20list%20of%20project%20names%2Cto%20match%20the%20root-directories&repository-name=remotion-on-vercel&repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fremotion-dev%2Ftemplate-vercel&root-directories=List%20of%20directory%20paths%20for%20the%20directories%20to%20clone%20into%20projects)

Or, [visit the Remotion on Vercel template ](https://vercel.com/templates/template/remotion-on-vercel) on Vercel's template marketplace.

### Manual

Use the Vercel template:

```bash
npx create-video@latest --template vercel
```

Push it to Vercel.

Then, in your Vercel dashboard, under "Storage", create a new Blob store and connect it to the project.  
Redeploy for the changes to take effect.

## Advantages

This is the easiest way to setup Remotion server-side rendering. You only need one Vercel account and connect a blob storage - then you just push to deploy.

Vercel has higher limits than Lambda by default, so you can render more videos at once than with a fresh AWS account.

Allowing for 2000 concurrent sandboxes on the Pro Plan allows for massive scale.

## Limitations

Rendering happens on a single machine rather than a distributed system, so it is slower than Lambda.

Spawning a new VM for each render has a setup phase which includes installing dependencies and downloading a browser.  
We plan to soon improve this by using Vercel Sandbox snapshots.

Currently, the browser downloaded does not have support for decoding H.264, meaning that using [`@remotion/media`](/docs/media) will often fallback to [`<OffthreadVideo>`](/docs/offthreadvideo).  
We also plan to resolve this by using a custom build of Chrome soon.

## Limits

The timeout limit for Vercel Sandbox is 45 minutes on the Hobby plan, and 5 hours on the Pro and Enterprise plans.  
For concurrency, the limit is 10 simultaneous renders on Hobby, and 2000 on Pro and Enterprise.
