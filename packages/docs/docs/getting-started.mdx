## Prerequisites

To use Remotion, you need at least [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) <MinNodeVersion /> or [Bun](https://bun.sh) <MinBunVersion />.

## Scaffolding a new project

:::note
üêß [Linux distros need at least version 2.35 of Libc.](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/issues/2439)  
They also need to [install some additional packages](/docs/miscellaneous/linux-dependencies).  
Alpine Linux and nixOS are unsupported.

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{ label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
{ label: 'bun', value: 'bun', },
{ label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm', },
{ label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash title="Use npm as the package manager"
npx create-video@latest
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

Choose the template that is most suitable for you.  
For your first project, we recommend the [Hello World](/templates/hello-world) template.

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{ label: 'Regular templates', value: 'npm', },
{ label: 'Next.js + React Router 7', value: 'pnpm', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

After the project has been scaffolded, we recommend to open the project in your text editor and starting the [Remotion Studio](/docs/studio):

```bash
npm run dev
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

After the project has been scaffolded, we recommend to open the project in your text editor and starting the app:
