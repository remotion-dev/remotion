# seek()<AvailableFrom v="4.0.259"/>

Jump to a position in time in the Remotion Studio.

If a number smaller than 0 is passed, the value will be automatically clamped to 0.  
If a number greater than or equal to the duration of the composition is passed, the value will be automatically clamped to `durationInFrames - 1`.

Use [`useVideoConfig()`](/docs/use-video-config) to get the duration of the composition.

## Examples

```tsx twoslash title="Saving {color: 'green'} to Root.tsx"
import {seek} from '@remotion/studio';

seek(100);
```
