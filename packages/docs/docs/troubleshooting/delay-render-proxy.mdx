The error message `A delayRender() "Loading <Img> with src=http://localhost:3000/proxy?src=[...]&time=[...]&transparent=[...]" was called but not cleared after 28000ms. See https://remotion.dev/docs/timeout for help`:

```
A delayRender() "Loading <Img> with src=http://localhost:3000/proxy?src=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fpublic%2Fbackground.mp4&time=683.45&transparent=false" was called but not cleared after 28000ms. See https://remotion.dev/docs/timeout for help

occurs when loading an [`<OffthreadVideo>`](/docs/offthreadvideo) and the frame cannot be extracted within the [timeout](/docs/cli/render#--timeout).

To be able to extract a frame, `<OffthreadVideo>` needs to:

- Download the file in full
- Open the file and seek to the correct position
- Decode the frame and convert it into an image

Especially for large files which take some time to download, this error may occur.

## Use `<Video>` from `@remotion/media`

The new [`<Video>`](/docs/media/video) tag from [`@remotion/media`](/docs/media) doesn't have the constraint that the entire video needs to be downloaded in order to extract a frame. Consider using it instead of `<OffthreadVideo>`.

See: [Comparison of video tags](/docs/video-tags)

## Increase the timeout

Consider increasing the timeout using the [`delayRenderTimeoutInMilliseconds`](/docs/offthreadvideo/#delayrendertimeoutinmilliseconds) prop.

## Debug using verbose logging

You can also [enable verbose logging](/docs/troubleshooting/debug-failed-render) to see the progress of the work that `<OffthreadVideo>` is doing. In the usual case, you can understand from the timings why the timeout occurred.

## Chunk the video

Currently, `<OffthreadVideo>` needs to download the entire video in order to extract a frame (we work on eliminating this need in the future).

If you are loading a large video, consider chunking it into smaller parts and only load part of the video at a time.

For example, create a `<Series>` of `<OffthreadVideo>` components, each with a different `src` prop.

```tsx twoslash
import {Series, useVideoConfig, OffthreadVideo, staticFile} from 'remotion';

const parts = ['part1.mp4', 'part2.mp4', 'part3.mp4'];

const SeriesTesting: React.FC = () => {
  const {fps} = useVideoConfig();

  return (
    <Series>
      {parts.map((part) => {
        return (
          <Series.Sequence durationInFrames={30 * 60}>
            <OffthreadVideo src={staticFile(part)} />
          </Series.Sequence>
        );
      })}
    </Series>
  );
};
```

## Use a faster CDN

Ensure using a place to host your video that has enough egress bandwidth capacity.  
Place the video onto a server that is close to your render geographically.
