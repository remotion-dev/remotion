If your render is stuck, proceed as follows:

## Check for long `delayRender()` calls

If the `delayRender()` timeout is too big and does not resolve, a render may get stuck indefinitely without an error message.

This issue may be more confusing on Remotion Lambda, whose runtime also has a timeout.  
If the `delayRender()` timeout is bigger than the Lambda function timeout, the Lambda function will first time out without the `delayRender()` call failing first, leading to no error message.  

To debug the issue:

- Set the `delayRender()` timeout value to a smaller value, so that if it does not resolve, an error message is shown.
- Always sse [`cancelRender()`](/docs/cancel-render) to handle any error that prevents you from calling `continueRender()`.

## Enable verbose logging

[Enable verbose logging](/docs/troubleshooting/debug-failed-render) to see if there are any failures from the browser or other child processes.

## Ensure Chrome Headless Shell is used

Newer Chrome versions may not work with Remotion anymore and cause a render to get stuck, because they have removed the Headless mode.  
Instead, you need to migrate to the [Chrome Headless Shell](/docs/miscellaneous/chrome-headless-shell).

:::note
This issue does not occur on Remotion Lambda.
:::

Follow these best practices:

- Do not download Chrome from a Linux package manager.
- Do not set the `--chrome-executable` option and let Remotion download a compatible version of Chrome Headless Shell for you.
- Use [`npx remotion browser ensure`](/docs/cli/browser/ensure) to make sure a compatible versions of Chrome Headless Shell is ready before the first render.

## Lambda: Are you reading the `errors` field?

If the [`overallProgress`](/docs/lambda/getrenderprogress#overallprogress) field is stuck on Lambda, ensure that you are:

- Reading the [`errors`](/docs/lambda/getrenderprogress#errors) field to see if there are any errors.
- not further polling [`getRenderProgress()`](/docs/lambda/getrenderprogress) if the [`fatalErrorEncountered`](/docs/lambda/getrenderprogress#fatalerrorencountered) field is `true`.
