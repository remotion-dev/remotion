## Render timeout when loading Google Fonts

When using `@remotion/google-fonts`, you may encounter timeout errors like:

```diff
- A delayRender() "Fetching Inter font {"style":"normal","weight":"100","subset":"cyrillic-ext"}" was called but not cleared after 58000ms.
```

### Problem

By default, `loadFont()` attempts to load all available font weights and character subsets, which can cause timeouts.

### Solution

Only load the specific font weights and character subsets that your project needs:

```tsx
import {loadFont} from '@remotion/google-fonts/Inter';

// ❌ Avoid: Loading all weights and subsets
loadFont();

// ✅ Recommended: Load only required weights and subsets
loadFont('normal', {
  subsets: ['latin'],
  weights: ['400', '700'], // Only load regular (400) and bold (700)
});
```
