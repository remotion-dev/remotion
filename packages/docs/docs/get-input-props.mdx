_Available from v2.0_.

Using this method, you can retrieve inputs that you pass in from the command line using [`--props`](/docs/cli), or the [`inputProps`](/docs/ssr) parameter if you are using the Node.JS APIs ([`renderMedia()`](/docs/renderer/render-media), [`renderMediaOnLambda()`](/docs/lambda/rendermediaonlambda)).

This method is useful if you want to retrieve the input props in the [root component](/docs/terminology/root-file).

:::info
This method is not available when inside a Remotion Player. Instead, get the props as React props from the component you passed as the `component` prop to the player.
:::

## You might not need this API

Prefer the following ways of getting your input props:

- A component that was rendered as a [composition](/docs/composition) will retrieve the input props as regular props.
- In the [root component](/docs/terminology/root-file), you can get the input props by using the [`calculateMetadata()`](/docs/calculate-metadata) function.

In both cases, you can type the props, which is better than using this API which returns a non-typesafe object.

## API

Pass in a [parseable](/docs/cli) JSON representation using the `--props` flag to either `remotion studio` or `remotion render`:

```bash
npx remotion render --props='{"hello": "world"}'
```

To simulate how it behaves, you can also pass props when using the Remotion Studio:

```bash
npx remotion studio --props='{"hello": "world"}'
```

You may also specify a file containing JSON and Remotion will parse the file for you:

```bash
npx remotion render --props=./path/to/props.json
```

You can then access the props anywhere in your Remotion project:

```tsx twoslash {3}
import {Composition} from 'remotion';
const getInputProps = () => ({hello: 'world'}) as const;
const MyComp: React.FC = () => null;
const config = {
  component: MyComp,
  durationInFrames: 100,
  fps: 30,
  width: 1000,
  height: 1000,
  id: 'MyComp',
} as const;
// ---cut---

export const Root: React.FC = () => {
  const {hello} = getInputProps(); // "world"

  return <Composition {...config} />;
};
```

In this example, the props also get passed to the component of the composition with the id `my-composition`.
