Upon finishing a conversion with [`convertMedia()`](/docs/webcodecs/convert-media), a HTTP request is sent to an endpoint on [`remotion.pro`](https://remotion.pro), registering the domain and whether the conversion was successful.

Telemetry will never cause any conversions to fail.

## Data collection

No user data is collected, however the IP address may be used to reject invalid telemetry.

## Use of data

Telemetry data helps Remotion understand which sites use the [`@remotion/webcodecs`](/docs/webcodecs) package.

Historically, it's been difficult to understand which sites use Remotion and various sizable companies have been using it without getting the appropriate license.

Hence we have decided to add telemetry to this new package.

Remotion will not share any telemetry data with others.

## Track conversions with an API key

You may add an API key that you obtained from [`remotion.pro`](https://remotion.pro) to the [`convertMedia()`](/docs/webcodecs/convert-media) function.

```tsx twoslash title="Adding an API key"
import {convertMedia} from '@remotion/webcodecs';

await convertMedia({
  src: 'https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4',
  container: 'webm',
  apiKey: 'rm_pub_abcdefghijklo',
});
```

You will then be able to see the amount of conversions you did on your dashboard.  
For now, you still need to adjust the license manually to cover your WebCodecs conversions.

## Disabling telemetry

A version of [`@remotion/webcodecs`](/docs/webcodecs) without telemetry can be obtained with an Remotion Enterprise License.  
Contact hi@remotion.dev to request an Enterprise License.
