[We are phasing out Remotion WebCodecs and are moving to Mediabunny](/blog/mediabunny)!  
**We recommend using [mediabunny for extracting frames](/docs/mediabunny/extract-frames) instead.**
:::

# extractFrames()<AvailableFrom v="4.0.311"/>

_Part of the [`@remotion/webcodecs`](/docs/webcodecs) package._

Extracts frames from a video at specific timestamps using [`parseMedia()`](/docs/media-parser/parse-media).

Since Remotion is migrating to [mediabunny](https://mediabunny.dev), we recommend using the [mediabunny-based frame extraction implementation](/docs/mediabunny/extract-frames) for new projects.

```tsx twoslash title="Extracting frames"
import {extractFrames} from '@remotion/webcodecs';

await extractFrames({
  src: 'https://remotion.media/video.mp4',
  timestampsInSeconds: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
  onFrame: (frame) => {
    console.log(frame);
    //           ^?
  },
});
```

## API

### `src`

A URL or `File`/`Blob`.

If it is a remote URL, it must support CORS.

### `timestampsInSeconds`

An array of timestamps in seconds, or a function that returns a promise resolving to an array of timestamps in seconds based on the video track.

Consider you wanting you to create a filmstrip of a video. You can do this by extracting as many frames as fit in a canvas.

```tsx twoslash title="Extracting as many frames as fit in a canvas"
import type {ExtractFramesTimestampsInSecondsFn} from '@remotion/webcodecs';

const toSeconds = 10;
const fromSeconds = 0;
const canvasWidth = 500;
const canvasHeight = 80;

const timestamps: ExtractFramesTimestampsInSecondsFn = async ({track}) => {
  const aspectRatio = track.width / track.height;
  const amountOfFramesFit = Math.ceil(canvasWidth / (canvasHeight * aspectRatio));
  const timestampsInSeconds: number[] = [];
  const segmentDuration = toSeconds - fromSeconds;

  for (let i = 0; i < amountOfFramesFit; i++) {
    timestampsInSeconds.push(fromSeconds + (segmentDuration / amountOfFramesFit) * (i + 0.5));
  }

  return timestampsInSeconds;
};
```

Note that currently, you can not get the duration of the video in seconds before the extraction.  
For this you need currently to make another [`parseMedia()`](/docs/media-parser/parse-media) call beforehand.

### `onFrame`

A callback that will be called with the frame at the given timestamp.  
Each frame is a [`VideoFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoFrame) object that can for example be drawn to a canvas.

### `acknowledgeRemotionLicense?`

Acknowledge the [Remotion License](/docs/license) to make the console message disappear.

### `signal?`

An optional [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) to abort the extraction.

### `logLevel?`

_string_ <TsType type="LogLevel" source="@remotion/media-parser"/>

One of `"error"`, `"warn"`, `"info"`, `"debug"`, `"trace"`.  
Default value: `"info"`, which logs only important information.
