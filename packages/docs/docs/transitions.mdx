# Transitions<AvailableFrom v="4.0.59"/>

import { TransitionsDuration } from "../components/TransitionsDuration";
import { Presentations } from "../components/TableOfContents/transitions/presentations";
import { Timings } from "../components/TableOfContents/transitions/timings";

To transition between two types of absolutely positioned content, you can use the [`<TransitionSeries>`](/docs/transitions/transitionseries) component.

```tsx twoslash title="SlideTransition.tsx"
import { AbsoluteFill } from "remotion";

const Letter: React.FC<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
  color: string;
}> = ({ children, color }) => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill
      style={{
        backgroundColor: color,
        opacity: 0.9,
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        fontSize: 200,
        color: "white",
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
// ---cut---
import { linearTiming, TransitionSeries } from "@remotion/transitions";
import { slide } from "@remotion/transitions/slide";

const BasicTransition = () => {
  return (
    <TransitionSeries>
      <TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={40}>
        <Letter color="#0b84f3">A</Letter>
      </TransitionSeries.Sequence>
      <TransitionSeries.Transition
        presentation={slide()}
        timing={linearTiming({ durationInFrames: 30 })}
      />
      <TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={60}>
        <Letter color="pink">B</Letter>
      </TransitionSeries.Sequence>
    </TransitionSeries>
  );
};
```

## Enter and exit animations

You don't necessarily have to use `<TransitionSeries>` for transitions between scenes. You can also use it to animate the entrace or exit of a scene by putting a transition first or last in the `<TransitionSeries>`.

[See example](/docs/transitions/transitionseries#enter-and-exit-animations)

## Duration

In the above example, `A` is visible for 40 frames, `B` for 60 frames and the duration of the transition is 30 frames.  
During this time, both slides are rendered. This means the total duration of the animation is `60 + 40 - 30 = 70`.

<TransitionsDuration />

## Presentations

A presentation determines the visual of animation.

<Presentations />

## Timings

A timing determines how long the animation takes and the animation curve.

<Timings />

## Audio transitions

See here how to include [audio effects](/docs/transitions/audio-transitions) in your transitions.

## Getting the duration of a transition

You can get the duration of a transition by calling `getDurationInFrames()` on the timing:

```tsx twoslash title="Assuming a framerate of 30fps"
import { springTiming } from "@remotion/transitions";

springTiming({ config: { damping: 200 } }).getDurationInFrames({ fps: 30 }); // 23
```

## Overlays

You can use `<TransitionSeries.Overlay>` to render content on top of the junction between two sequences without shortening the timeline. Unlike transitions, overlays do not cause the sequences to overlap — the total duration stays the same. The overlay is centered on the cut point by default.

This is useful for rendering effects like light leaks, flashes, or other visual elements that should appear over a cut without affecting timing.

See [`<TransitionSeries.Overlay>`](/docs/transitions/transitionseries#transitionseriesoverlay) for details.

## Rules

<Step>1</Step> It is forbidden to have a transition that is longer than the duration
of the previous or next sequence. <br />
<Step>2</Step> There can be no two transitions next to each other. <br />
<Step>3</Step> There must be at least one sequence before or after a transition. <br />
<Step>4</Step> An overlay and a transition cannot be adjacent. <br />
<Step>5</Step> Two overlays cannot be adjacent.
