title: Validating user videos
crumb: 'Building video apps'
---

When building an app that accepts user video uploads, you should validate whether the browser can decode the video before uploading it. This saves bandwidth, provides immediate feedback to the user, and reduces unnecessary server processing.

## Checking video compatibility

Use Remotion's [canDecode()](/docs/mediabunny/can-decode) snippet based on [Mediabunny](/docs/mediabunny) to check if a video can be decoded by the browser.

The `canDecode()` function checks if a video can be played in the browser and loaded into [`<Video>`](/docs/media/video) from `@remotion/media`.

:::note
Different Remotion video components have different format compatibilities:

- **[`<Video>`](/docs/media/video)**: Mediabunny-based custom video tag with broad format support
- **[`<Html5Video>`](/docs/html5-video)**: Uses browser's native decoding using `<video>` element
- **[`<OffthreadVideo>`](/docs/offthreadvideo)**: Supports more formats during rendering, uses `<Html5Video>` for preview in the Player and Studio

Learn more about the supported media formats: [Video formats](/docs/miscellaneous/video-formats)

## Validation example in React

:::note
This is a simplified example showing the validation flow. In a real application, the implementation will vary depending on your upload strategy (direct upload, presigned URLs, multipart uploads, etc.) and where you store videos (S3, GCS, your own server, etc.).
:::

```tsx twoslash title="ValidatedUploader.tsx"
const canDecode = async (src: string | Blob) => {
  return true;
};
const upload = async (file: File) => {
  return 'https://example.com/video.mp4';
};
// ---cut---

const handleUpload = async (file: File) => {
  const isCompatible = await canDecode(file);

  if (!isCompatible) {
    // Either notify user or reject the video
    alert('Video format not supported.');
    return;
  }

  try {
    const url = await upload(file);
    console.log('Video uploaded successfully:', url);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to process video:', error);
    alert('Failed to upload video');
  }
};
```

## Handling incompatible videos

When a video cannot be decoded, either:

- reject the video and ask the user to upload a different video
- re-encode the video on the backend.
