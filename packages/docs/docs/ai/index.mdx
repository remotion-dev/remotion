We are interested in how AI can help with realizing Remotion projects.

## AI-Ready Documentation

Remotion docs are optimized for AI agents:

- **Copy as Markdown**: Click the copy button on any doc page to copy raw markdown
- **Markdown URLs**: Add `.md` to any doc URL (e.g., `remotion.dev/docs/player.md`) to view/fetch raw markdown
- **Content negotiation**: Remotion docs respect the `Accept` header - request `text/markdown` to get markdown instead of HTML. Paste any Remotion doc link into Claude Code, opencode, or other AI coding agents and they'll automatically fetch the markdown version
