Remotion maintains a list of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) that define best practices for working in Remotion projects.

These skills are useful for AI agents like Claude Code, Codex or Cursor.

You can install them by running:

```bash
npx skills add remotion-dev/skills
```

You are also offered the option to add skills when you create a new Remotion project:

```bash
bun create video
```

The skills are also available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/tree/main/packages/skills).
