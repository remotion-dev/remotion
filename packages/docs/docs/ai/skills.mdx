Remotion maintains a list of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) that define best practices for working in Remotion projects.

These skills are useful for AI agents like Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, CodeBuddy, and more.

You can install them by running:

```bash
npx skills add remotion-dev/skills
```

:::note
**Using the local development version with CodeBuddy support:**

If you're working with the Remotion repository locally and want to use the version that includes CodeBuddy support, use:

```bash
# Using the wrapper script
bun run skills:add remotion-dev/skills

# Or directly with tsx
bunx tsx packages/add-skill/src/index.ts remotion-dev/skills

# Or using the built version
node scripts/skills-add.js remotion-dev/skills
```

The standard `npx skills add` command uses the npm package which may not include CodeBuddy support yet.
:::

You are also offered the option to add skills when you create a new Remotion project:

```bash
bun create video
```

The skills are also available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/tree/main/packages/skills).
