This page covers how to compile AI-generated Remotion code in the browser and display it in a live preview.

## Overview

To show a live preview without a server round-trip, the compilation pipeline:

1. **Extracts** the component body from the ES6 module format (removing imports)
2. **Transpiles** JSX/TypeScript to JavaScript using Babel in the browser
3. **Injects** Remotion APIs via a Function constructor
4. **Renders** the compiled component in the Remotion Player

:::note
This is a fast approach for prototyping and demos. For production apps, this approach carries some security considerations since AI-generated code runs in the user's browser. Consider Web Worker or iframe isolation to improve the security profile.

## Compilation Steps

### 1. Extract Component Body

The generated code arrives in ES6 module format with imports. Since we're injecting APIs directly, strip the import statements and extract just the component definition.

### 2. Babel Transpilation

Use `@babel/standalone` to transpile JSX and TypeScript in the browser. This converts the React/TypeScript code into plain JavaScript that can be executed.

Install via npm/yarn or include via CDN:

```bash
bun add @babel/standalone
```

### 3. API Injection

Create a Function constructor with all Remotion APIs passed as arguments. This makes `useCurrentFrame`, `spring`, `interpolate`, `Sequence`, `AbsoluteFill`, and other Remotion functions available to the generated code without requiring actual imports.

### 4. Player Rendering

Pass the compiled component to the Remotion Player for live preview. Handle errors gracefully to show meaningful feedback when compilation fails.

## Available APIs

The template injects a curated set of APIs that cover most animation needs:

**Core Remotion:**

- `useCurrentFrame`, `useVideoConfig`
- `spring`, `interpolate`, `interpolateColors`, `Easing`
- `Sequence`, `Series`, `AbsoluteFill`
- `Img`, `Audio`, `Video`, `OffthreadVideo`

**Extended Libraries:**

- `@remotion/shapes` - Rect, Circle, Triangle, Ellipse, Pie
- `@remotion/lottie` - Lottie animation support
- `@remotion/three` - ThreeCanvas for 3D scenes

## Error Handling

Wrap compilation in error handling to provide useful feedback:

- **Syntax errors** - Show the specific parse error from Babel
- **Missing exports** - Indicate the component couldn't be found
- **Runtime errors** - Catch and display errors during component execution
