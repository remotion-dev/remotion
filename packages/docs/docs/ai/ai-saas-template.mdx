We made [a Next.js starter template](https://www.remotion.dev/templates/prompt-to-motion-graphics) for building AI-powered motion graphics products.  
Users describe an animation in natural language, and the app generates and previews it in real-time.

[**Live Demo**](https://prompt-to-motion-graphics-saas.vercel.app/) (note: AI credits are limited and rendering disabled)

## Getting Started

Scaffold a new project:

```bash
npx create-video@latest --template prompt-to-motion-graphics
```

Then create a `.env` file:

```bash title=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to start generating animations.

## Difference to Remotion Agent Skills

Use this template if you want to build a SaaS with Remotion and AI.  
Use [Agent Skills](/docs/ai/claude-code) if you want to prompt videos for yourself.

Unlike the Agent Skills workflow, this template is not agentic by default. It does not have access to an operating system, tools or the filesystem.

## What's Included

- Chat interface with conversation history for iterative refinement
- Live preview - instant rendering in the Remotion Player
- Smart editing - the LLM decides between targeted edits or full replacement
- Input Validation - prevents end-user misuse
- Sanitation - cleans nondeterministic LLM outputs
- Self-correction - automatically retries on compilation errors

It streams [generated code](/docs/ai/generate) and compiles it in the browser using [just-in-time compilation](/docs/ai/dynamic-compilation).

## Images

There is an important difference between attaching images to the prompt and mentioning image URLs in the prompt.

- **Attaching images**: The assistant will try to replicate in code whatever you attach to the prompt, for example an abstract spiral.
- **Providing image URLs**: The assistant will embed the provided image within the animation based on the file URL. For example: _"Create a DVD screensaver animation of this image https://example.com/logo.png"_

## Lambda Rendering

To enable video exporting with [Remotion Lambda](/docs/lambda):

1. Set up Remotion Lambda following the [Lambda guide](/docs/lambda/setup)
2. Add AWS credentials to `.env`

```bash title=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Add AWS credentials for Lambda rendering
REMOTION_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
REMOTION_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

3. Deploy with `npm run deploy`.
