We made a Chatbot that can answer simple questions about Remotion.

The Chatbot uses [CrawlChat](https://crawlchat.app) to index Remotion's documentation and make it queryable.

You can invoke it either by:

- Clicking on the "Ask AI" button anywhere on our docs
- Visiting [remotion.ai](https://remotion.ai)
- Pressing <kbd>âŒ˜/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> while in the [Studio](/docs/studio)

For more complicated questions, you can ask human intelligence.  
Join us on our [Discord](https://remotion.dev/discord) where you can get help.
