You can use Remotion's Model Context Protocol (MCP) Client to make your editor's AI Chat better at understanding Remotion.

Our MCP server uses [CrawlChat](https://crawlchat.app)'s technology to index Remotion's documentation into a vector database.

:::warning
**Test Phase**: Right now, this tool is open without authentication. If running this tool gets too expensive, we might restrict the usage.

## Cursor

### One-Click Install

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en-US/install-mcp?name=remotion-documentation&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IiwiYXJncyI6WyJAcmVtb3Rpb24vbWNwQGxhdGVzdCJdfQ%3D%3D)

### Manual Installation

<Step>1</Step> Go to your Cursor Settings: <kbd>Cmd+Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>, then type `> Cursor Settings` and confirm with Enter.

<Step>2</Step> Add an MCP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remotion-documentation": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@remotion/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

If this worked, a green dot should show up and the tool `remotion-documentation` should show up.

If you now ask Cursor in the composer to use the Remotion Documentation, the MCP should get invoked.
