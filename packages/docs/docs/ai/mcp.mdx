You can use Remotion's Model Context Protocol (MCP) Client to make your editor's AI Chat better at understanding Remotion.

Our MCP server uses [CrawlChat](https://crawlchat.app)'s technology to index Remotion's documentation into a vector database and

:::warning
**Test Phase**: Right now, this tool is open without authentication. If running this tool gets too expensive, we might restrict the usage.
:::

To set it up:

<Step>1</Step> Go to your Cursor Settings: <kbd>Cmd+Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>, then type `> Cursor Settings` and confirm with Enter.

<Step>2</Step> Add an MCP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remotion-documentation": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@remotion/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

If this worked, a green dot should show up and the tool `remotion-documentation` should show up.

If you now ask Cursor in the composer to use the Remotion Documentation, the MCP should get invoked.
