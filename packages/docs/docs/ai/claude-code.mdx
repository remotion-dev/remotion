You can create videos just from prompting.  
This is an easy way to get started with Remotion!

## Prerequisites

You first need to install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).  
Claude Code requires a paid subscription.

## Start a new project

Create a new project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-video@latest
```

This will create a new project - we recommend the following settings:

- Select the [Blank](https://remotion.dev/templates/blank) template
- Say yes to use [TailwindCSS](/docs/tailwind)
- Say yes to install [Skills](/docs/ai/skills)

## Start the preview

First, go into the directory that was created.  
If you named your project `my-video`, you would run the following command:

```bash
cd my-video
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Start the project using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Start Claude

Open a separate terminal window and start Claude:

```bash
cd my-video
claude
```

You can now prompt a video! See our video above for a few ideas on how to start.
