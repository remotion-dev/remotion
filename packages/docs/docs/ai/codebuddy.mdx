You can create videos just from prompting using CodeBuddy.  
This is an easy way to get started with Remotion!

## Prerequisites

You first need to install [CodeBuddy](https://www.codebuddy.ai/docs/zh/cli/overview) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

## Installing CodeBuddy

Install CodeBuddy globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @tencent-ai/codebuddy-code
```

## Start a new project

Create a new project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-video@latest
```

This will create a new project - we recommend the following settings:

- Select the [Empty](https://remotion.dev/templates/empty) template
- Say yes to use [TailwindCSS](/docs/tailwind)
- Say yes to install [Skills](/docs/ai/skills)

## Start the preview

First, go into the directory that was created.  
If you named your project `my-video`, you would run the following command:

```bash
cd my-video
```

Start the project using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Start CodeBuddy

Open a separate terminal window and start CodeBuddy:

```bash
cd my-video
codebuddy
```

You can now prompt a video!
