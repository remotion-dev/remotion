import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import {TableOfContents} from './table-of-contents';

This package provides functions for preloading assets. While preload is not necessary for rendering, it can help with seamless playback in the [`<Player />`](/docs/player) and in the Studio. Currently, three functions are implemented:

<TableOfContents />

An alternative to `@remotion/preload` is the [`prefetch()`](/docs/prefetch) API. See [`@remotion/preload` vs `prefetch()`](/docs/player/preloading#remotionpreload-vs-prefetch) to decide which one is better for your usecase.
