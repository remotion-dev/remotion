The following error may occur in your Remotion project during development or while rendering:

```diff
- Error: Could not play video with src [source] [object MediaError]
```

or

```diff
- Error: Could not play audio with src [source] [object MediaError]
```

This error happens when you are trying to embed a `<Video/>` or `<Audio/>` tag in your Remotion project but the browser is unable to load and play the media. Although the browser does not report the exact error, there are two common reasons for this error.

## Codec not supported by Chrome

Chrome does not support all codecs for playback. For example: HEVC on Linux, `.avi`, `.flv`, `.m3u8`.  
Convert the video to a format that is supported by Chrome.

## Invalid source

Make sure you are trying to load a video that is either available locally or publicly on the internet. Open the DevTools, go to the Network tab, track the asset being loaded, and open it in a new tab. Does it actually start playing?

## Wrong headers or status code

In order for the browser being able to play the media, it should be loaded with:

- a 200 status code
- a suitable `Content-Type` header
- A `Content-Range` header in order to support seeking.

Open the DevTools and go to the network tab to validate that this is the case.

## Internet Download Manager

[Internet Download Manager](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/) is known to manipulate the network traffic causing problems for the browser to load media. Disable it if you have it.

## Other unsupported codecs

You might be importing a video that is not compatible with Chrome at all, e.g. FLV.

## Too many video tags

The error message might contain `error creating media player`, appearing if too many video tags are created.  
First check that you are not accidentially creating an infite render loop. For example, changing the `key` frequently will re-create the video tag on every frame:

```tsx twoslash
const uuidv4 = () => '';

// ---cut---
import {Video} from 'remotion';

export default function SBSVideo() {
  return (
    <>
      {['https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4', 'https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4'].map((video, i) => {
        return <Video key={uuidv4()} src={video} />;
      })}
    </>
  );
}
```

If you ruled out this possibility, use [`<OffthreadVideo>`](/docs/offthreadvideo) instead as it does not rely on a `<video>` tag.

## Recover from this error<AvailableFrom v="3.3.89" />

You can handle this error and replace it with a different video by passing the `onError()` prop to the `<Video>` or `<OffthreadVideo>` component.
