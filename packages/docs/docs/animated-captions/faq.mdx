# Animated Captions FAQ

## Does this support Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Romanian language?

It depends on the font. The default font is [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat), which does support all of the above languages.  
You also need to be able to [generate the captions](/docs/captions) in your preferred language. This is out of the scope of this component.
