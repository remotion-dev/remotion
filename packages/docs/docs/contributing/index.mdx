Please note that since we charge for Remotion when companies are using it, this is a **commercial project**.  
By sending pull requests, you agree that we can use your code changes in a commercial context.

Furthermore, also note that you **cannot redistribute** this project. Please see [LICENSE.md](https://remotion.dev/license) for what's allowed and what's not.

## Setup

<Step>1</Step> Remotion uses [`Bun`](https://bun.com) v1.3.0 as the package manager for development in this repository. The version must be at least `1.3.0`.

```
curl -fsSL https://bun.com/install | bash -s "bun-v1.3.0"
```

<Step>2</Step> Clone the Remotion repository:

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion.git && cd remotion
```

:::note
The full Git history of Remotion is large. To save time and disk space, we recommend adding `--depth=1` to only clone the most recent `main` branch.
:::

<Step>3</Step> Install all dependencies:

```sh
bun i
```

<Step>4</Step> Build the project initially:

```sh
bun run build
```

<Step>5</Step> Rebuild whenever a file changes:

```sh
bun run watch
```

<Step>6</Step> You can start making changes!

## Coming from pnpm

Before using Bun, we used pnpm as the package manager. If you are coming from pnpm, you need to wipe all node_modules folders first before you run `bun i`.

```sh
bun run cleanall
```

## Testing your changes

You can start the Testbed using

```sh
cd packages/example
bun run dev
```

You can render a test video using

```sh
cd packages/example
bunx remotion render
```

You can run tests using

```sh
bun run test
```

in either a subpackage to run tests for that package or in the root to run all tests.

## Running the `@remotion/player` testbed

You can test changes to [@remotion/player](https://remotion.dev/docs/player) by starting the Player testbed:

```sh
cd packages/player-example
bun run dev
```

For information about testing Remotion components, please consult the [Testing Remotion components](/docs/testing) page. Issues and pull requests of all sorts are welcome!

## Running documentation

You can run the Docusaurus server that powers our docs using:

```sh
cd packages/docs
bun run start
```

## Running the CLI

You can test changes to the CLI by moving to `packages/examples` directory and using `bunx` to execute the CLI:

```sh
cd packages/examples
# Example - Get available compositions
bunx remotion compositions
# Example - Render command
bunx remotion render ten-frame-tester --output ../../out/video.mp4
```

## Testing Remotion Lambda

In `packages/example`, there is a `runlambda.sh` script that will rebuild the code for the Lambda function, remove any deployed Lambda functions, deploy a new one and render a video.  
You need to put you [AWS credentials](/docs/lambda/authentication) in a `.env` file of the `packages/example` directory.

```sh
cd packages/example
sh ./runlambda.sh
```

:::note
This will delete any Lambda functions in your account!
:::

## Testing Remotion Cloud Run

In `packages/example`, there is a `runcloudrun.sh` script that will rebuild the code for the Cloud Run function, remove any deployed Cloud Run services, deploy a new one and render a video.  
You need to put you [GCP credentials](/docs/cloudrun/generate-env) in a `.env` file of the `packages/example` directory.

```sh
cd packages/example
sh ./runcloudrun.sh
```

:::note
This will delete any Cloud Run services in your account!
:::

## Troubleshooting

If your `bun run build` throws errors, oftentimes it is because of caching issues. You can resolve many of these errors by running

```ts
bun run clean
```

in the root directory. Make sure to beforehand kill any `bun run watch` commands, as those might regenerate files as you clean them!
