The code for `@remotion/web-renderer` is located in the `packages/web-renderer` folder.  
Before running any of these commands, do the [main setup](/docs/contributing).

## Developing in watch mode

To develop the web renderer, you can use the watch mode:

```sh title="In ./"
bun run watchwebrenderer
```

This will automatically rebuild the package when you make changes to the code.

## Running tests

This package uses test-driven development. Changes are tested using [Vitest Browser Mode](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/why.html).

First you need to install the browser dependencies:

```sh title="In packages/web-renderer"
bunx playwright install --with-deps
```

Then you can run the tests:

```sh
bun run testwebrenderer
```

To only run a specific test file, you can specify the file name:

```sh
bunx vitest src/test/video.test.tsx
```

To only run a specific test, you can change `test()` to `test.only()`.

To only run the test in a specific browser, you can specify the browser name:

```sh
bunx vitest --browser chromium
bunx vitest --browser firefox
bunx vitest --browser webkit
```

## Enabling the Studio Render Button

Set the following to `true` in `packages/studio/src/helpers/show-browser-rendering.ts`:

```ts
export const SHOW_BROWSER_RENDERING = true;
```

Now, in [`packages/example`](/docs/contributing/#testing-your-changes), and in any template, you will see a "Render on web" button.

Don't commit this, the CI will fail.

Eventually, this flag will be removed and the button will be enabled by default.  
If this happened and this instruction remains here, please send a PR to remove it :)
