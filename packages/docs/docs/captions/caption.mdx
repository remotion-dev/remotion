# Caption<AvailableFrom v="4.0.216"/>

This is a simple data structure for a caption.

```tsx twoslash
import type {Caption} from '@remotion/captions';
//            ^?
```

By establishing a standard data structure, we allow many operations that involve captions to be interoperable:

- **Transcribing**: Using the [`@remotion/install-whisper-cpp`](/docs/install-whisper-cpp) or [`@remotion/openai-whisper`](/docs/openai-whisper) packages
- **Formatting**: For example, creating pages using [`createTikTokStyleCaptions()`](/docs/captions/create-tiktok-style-captions)
- **Parsing**: Using the [`parseSrt()`](/docs/captions/parse-srt) function
- **Serializing**: For example to a `.srt` file using [`serializeSrt()`](/docs/captions/serialize-srt)

## Fields

### `text`

The text of the caption.

### `startMs`

The start time of the caption in milliseconds.

### `endMs`

The end time of the caption in milliseconds.

### `timestampMs`

The timestamp of the caption as a singular timestamp in milliseconds.  
When using [`@remotion/install-whisper-cpp`](/docs/install-whisper-cpp), this the `t_dtw` value.  
Otherwise, it is not defined, but may be the average of the start and end timestamps.

### `confidence`

A number between 0 and 1 that indicates how confident the transcription is.

## Whitespace sensitivity

The `text` field is white-space sensitive. You should include spaces in it, as none are added automatically.  
While rendering, apply the `white-space: pre` CSS property to the container of the caption to ensure that the spaces are preserved.
