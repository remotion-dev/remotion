# Status of Remotion Cloud Run

**Remotion Cloud Run is currently not being actively developed.**  
Critical bugs are fixed, but no new features are being added.

You should rely on Remotion Cloud Run only if you are satisfied with what it currently offers.

## Why is Cloud Run not being actively developed?

Cloud Run is a separate implementation from Remotion Lambda, but a way less popular way to render videos.  
Development time is slow, as for every change, a Docker image needs to be rebuilt and deployed.
This makes it hard to iterate fast on the product.

Remotion Cloud Run was never marked as production-ready, and now lacks many features compared to Remotion Lambda.

Our plan is to in the future adapt the Lambda runtime for it to also power Remotion Cloud Run.  
This allows us to keep feature parity between Lambda and Cloud Run.

To not slow down progress of this plan, which will be a new package, we are not actively developing Remotion Cloud Run.
