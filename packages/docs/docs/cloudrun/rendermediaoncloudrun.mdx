Kicks off a media rendering process on Remotion Cloud Run.

Requires a [service](/docs/cloudrun/deployservice) to already be deployed to execute the render.  
A [site](/docs/cloudrun/deploysite) or a [Serve URL](/docs/terminology/serve-url) needs to be specified to determine what will be rendered.

## Example

```tsx twoslash
// ---cut---
import {renderMediaOnCloudrun} from '@remotion/cloudrun/client';

const result = await renderMediaOnCloudrun({
  region: 'us-east1',
  serviceName: 'remotion-render-bds9aab',
  composition: 'MyVideo',
  serveUrl: 'https://storage.googleapis.com/remotioncloudrun-123asd321/sites/abcdefgh',
  codec: 'h264',
});

if (result.type === 'success') {
  console.log(result.bucketName);
  console.log(result.renderId);
}
```

:::note
Import from [`@remotion/cloudrun/client`](/docs/cloudrun/light-client) to not load the whole renderer, which cannot be bundled.
:::

## Arguments

An object with the following properties:

### `cloudRunUrl?`

_optional. Required if serviceName not supplied_

The url of the Cloud Run service which should be used to perform the render. You must set either cloudRunUrl or serviceName, but not both

### `serviceName?`

_optional. Required if cloudRunUrl not supplied_

The name of the Cloud Run service which should be used to perform the render. This is used in conjunction with the region to determine the service endpoint, as the same service name can exist across multiple regions.

### `region`

In which [GCP region](/docs/cloudrun/region-selection) your Cloud Run service is deployed. It's highly recommended that your Remotion site is also in the same region.

### `serveUrl`

A URL pointing to a Remotion project. Use [`deploySite()`](/docs/cloudrun/deploysite) to deploy a Remotion project.

### `composition`

The `id` of the [composition](/docs/composition) you want to render.

### `codec`

Which codec should be used to encode the video.

Video codecs `h264`, `vp8` and `prores` are supported.

Audio codecs `mp3`, `aac` and `wav` are also supported.

See also [`renderMedia() -> codec`](/docs/renderer/render-media#codec).

### `metadata`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.216" />

_object - optional_

<Options id="metadata" />

### `inputProps?`

_optional_

[Input Props to pass to the selected composition of your video.](/docs/passing-props#passing-input-props-in-the-cli).  
Must be a JSON object.  
From the root component the props can be read using [`getInputProps()`](/docs/get-input-props).  
You may transform input props using [`calculateMetadata()`](/docs/calculate-metadata).

### `privacy?`

_optional_

One of:

- `"public"` (_default_): The rendered media is publicly accessible under the Cloud Storage URL.
- `"private"`: The rendered media is not publicly available, but is available within the GCP project to those with the correct permissions.

### `forceBucketName?`

_optional_

Specify a specific bucket name to be used for the output. The resulting Google Cloud Storage URL will be in the format `gs://{bucket-name}/renders/{render-id}/{file-name}`. If not set, Remotion will choose the right bucket to use based on the region.

### `updateRenderProgress?`

_optional_

A callback that is called with the progress of the render.

### `renderStatusWebhook?`

_optional_

Your webhook URL that will be called with the progress of the render. This will be sent using a POST request.

#### Arguments

- `url`: The webhook URL endpoint.
- `headers`: The headers to send. `Content-Type: application/json` is added automatically.
- `data`: The data that you want to be sent alongside the progress data.
- `webhookProgressInterval (optional)`: The interval at which the webhook is called. Defaults to 0.1 (10%). (min: 0.01, max: 1)

```json title="Example Webhook URL Declaration"
{
  "url": "https://example.com/webhook",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer 1234567890"
  },
  "data": {
    "projectId": "1234567890"

  "projectId": "1234567890"
}
```

### `renderIdOverride`

_optional_

Provide a specific render ID for the render. Otherwise a random one will be generated.

:::note
You will be responsible for ensuring that the render ID is unique, otherwise it will overwrite existing renders with the same configured Render ID.
:::

### `audioCodec?`

_optional_

Choose the encoding of your audio.

- Choose `pcm-16` if you need uncompressed audio.
- Not all video containers support all audio codecs.

A number describing how long the render may take to resolve all [`delayRender()`](/docs/delay-render) calls [before it times out](/docs/timeout). Default: `30000`

### `concurrency?`

A number or a string describing how many browser tabs should be opened. Default "50%".

:::note
Before v4.0.76, this was "100%" by default. It is now aligned to the other server-side rendering APIs.

## Return value

Returns a promise resolving to an object.

### `type`

Use this to determine the structure of the response. It can either be:

- 'success' - render has been performed successfully.
- 'crash - Cloud Run service has crashed.

## Return when type === 'success'

The resulting object contains the following:

### `type`

'success' - render has been performed successfully.

### `publicUrl?`

_optional_

The publicly accessible URL of the rendered file. Only available when the request had the [`privacy`](/docs/cloudrun/rendermediaoncloudrun#privacy) property set to 'public'.

### `renderId`

A unique alphanumeric identifier for this render. Useful for obtaining status and finding the relevant files in the Cloud Storage bucket.

### `bucketName`

The Cloud Storage bucket name in which all files are being saved.

### `privacy`

Privacy of the output file, either:

- "public-read" - Publicly accessible under the Cloud Storage URL.
- "project-private" - Not publicly available, but is available within the GCP project to those with the correct permissions.

### `publicUrl`

If the privacy is set to public, this will be the publicly accessible URL of the rendered file. If the privacy is not public, this will be null.

### `cloudStorageUri`

Google Storage path, beginning with `gs://{bucket-name}`. Can be used with the [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) CLI tool.

### `size`

Size of the rendered media in KB.

## Return when type === 'crash'

The resulting object contains the following:

### `type`

'crash' - Cloud Run service has crashed without a response.

### `cloudRunEndpoint`

Endpoint that was called when executing the render. Used by the CLI to parse the service name to determine timeout and memory limit of the service. This can then be used when analysing the logs, to provide a hint as to the reason of the crash.

### `message`

'Service crashed without sending a response. Check the logs in GCP console.' This is used by the CLI for displaying an error message.

### `requestStartTime`

datetime of when the request was made, in UTC format - "2020-01-01T00:00:00+02:00". Can be useful for filtering the logs of the service.

### `requestCrashTime`

datetime of when the crash was detected, in UTC format - "2020-01-01T00:00:00+02:00". Can be useful for filtering the logs of the service.

### `requestElapsedTimeInSeconds`

Seconds elapsed between the request start and crash time. Can be checked against the timeout limit to understand if this was the likely cause of the crash.
