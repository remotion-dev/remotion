```bash
npx remotion cloudrun sites create <entry-point>?
```

You may pass an [entry point](/docs/terminology/entry-point) as the first argument, otherwise the entry point will be [determined](/docs/terminology/entry-point#which-entry-point-is-being-used).

Bundle and upload a Remotion video to a Cloud Storage bucket.

The result will be a URL such as `https://storage.googleapis.com/remotioncloudrun-12345/sites/mySite123/index.html`.

:::note
If you make changes locally, you need to redeploy the site. Use [`--site-name`](#--site-name) to overwrite an existing site.
:::

You can use this "Serve URL" to render a video on Remotion Cloud Run using:

- The [`npx remotion cloudrun render`](/docs/cloudrun/cli/render) command.
- Locally using the [`renderMedia()`](/docs/renderer/render-media) and [`renderStill()`](/docs/renderer/render-still) functions.
- Locally using the [`npx remotion render`](/docs/cli) and [`npx remotion still`](/docs/cli) commands

If you are rendering on Cloud Run, you can also pass the site Name (in this case `mySite123`) as an abbreviation.

## `--region`

The [GCP region](/docs/cloudrun/region-selection) to select. The service accessing the site should also be in this same region to minimise latency.

## `--site-name`

Uploads the project to a specific directory and returns a deterministic URL. If a site already existed under this name, in the same region, it will be overwritten. Can only contain the following characters: `0-9`, `a-z`, `A-Z`, `-`, `!`, `_`, `.`, `*`, `'`, `(`, `)`

```
npx remotion cloudrun sites create src/index.ts --site-name=another-site
```
