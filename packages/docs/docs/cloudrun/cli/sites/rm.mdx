## `--region`

The [GCP region](/docs/cloudrun/region-selection) to remove sites from.

:::note
The `rm` command does not support the --all-regions flag, as it is possible to have the same site name in multiple regions. This makes it difficult to remove multiple site-names from multiple regions.
:::

## `--yes`, `-y`

Removes a site (or multiple) without asking for confirmation.

```
npx remotion cloudrun sites rm central-site -y
```
