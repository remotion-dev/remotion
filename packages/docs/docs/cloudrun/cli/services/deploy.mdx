```
npx remotion cloudrun services deploy
```

Creates a new service in your GCP project. If a service exists in the same region, with the same Remotion version, with the same amount of memory, disk space and timeout duration, the name of the already deployed service will be returned instead.

## `--region`

The [GCP region](/docs/cloudrun/region-selection) to select. The site that the service will be accessing should also be in this same region to minimise latency.

## `--memoryLimit`

The upper bound on the amount of RAM that the Cloud Run service can consume. Default: 2 GB.

## `--cpuLimit`

The maximum number of CPU cores that the Cloud Run service can use to process requests. Default: 1.0.

## `--minInstances`

The minimum number of service instances to have available, regardless of requests. Default: 0.

:::note
Any running instances, even if they are not performing a render, will be billable in GCP. The default minimum number of instances is zero, which means that when no requests are made to your service, you are not billed.
:::

## `--maxInstances`

The maximum number of service instances that can be create by GCP in response to incoming requests. Default: 100.

## `--timeoutSeconds`

Timeout of the Cloud Run service. Default: 300 seconds.

:::info
Not to be confused with the [`--timeout` flag when rendering which defines the timeout for `delayRender()`](/docs/cli/render#--timeout).
:::

## `--onlyAllocateCpuDuringRequestProcessing`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.221" />

If this is set to true, `cpu_idle` will be set to `true` in the service manifest.  
CPU alloction will be disabled while no request is being processed, which can lead to significant cost savings.

## `--quiet`, `-q`

Only logs the service name, and 'Authenticated access granted'.
