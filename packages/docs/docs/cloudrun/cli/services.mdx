The `npx remotion cloudrun services` command allows you to deploy, view and delete GCP Cloud Run services that can render videos and stills.

## Subcommands

- [`deploy`](/docs/cloudrun/cli/services/deploy) - Creates a new service in your GCP project
- [`ls`](/docs/cloudrun/cli/services/ls) - Lists the services deployed to GCP in a region
- [`rm`](/docs/cloudrun/cli/services/rm) - Removes one or more services from your GCP project
- [`rmall`](/docs/cloudrun/cli/services/rmall) - Removes all services from your GCP project for a region

You only need one service per GCP region and Remotion version.
