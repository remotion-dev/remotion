This document describes the necessary permissions for Remotion Cloud Run and explains to those interested why the permissions are necessary.

For a step by step guide on how to set up permissions, [follow the setup guide](/docs/cloudrun/setup).

## Service Account permissions

This policy should be assigned to the **Remotion Service Account**. Following the automated setup, this is achieved by creating a custom role with the title _Remotion API Service Account_, and assigning that role to the Remotion Service Account.

To view and manually edit roles in your GCP project, go to the [Roles page within IAM admin](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/roles).

To view and manually edit permissions/roles assigned to Users or Service Accounts in your GCP project, go to the [IAM page within IAM Admin](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam).

## Validation

There are two ways in which you can test if the permissions for the service account have been correctly set up. Either you execute the following command:

```bash
npx remotion cloudrun permissions
```

or if you want to validate it programmatically, using the [`testPermissions()`](/docs/cloudrun/testpermissions) function.
