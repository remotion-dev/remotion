Removes a Remotion project from your Cloud Storage bucket.

Each project is located in the `sites/` subdirectory of your Cloud Storage bucket. Calling this function is equivalent of deleting all files inside a subfolder of your `sites/` subdirectory.

## Example

Gets all sites and deletes them.

```ts twoslash
import {GcpRegion, deleteSite, getSites} from '@remotion/cloudrun';

const region: GcpRegion = 'australia-southeast1';

const {sites} = await getSites(region);

for (const site of sites) {
  await deleteSite({
    bucketName: site.bucketName,
    siteName: site.id,
  });
  console.log(`Site ${site.id} deleted.`);
}
```

## Arguments

An object with the following properties:

### `bucketName`

_string_

The name of the Cloud Storage bucket in which your site resides in.

### `siteName`

_string_

The unique ID of the project you want to delete.

## Return value

A promise resolving nothing.
