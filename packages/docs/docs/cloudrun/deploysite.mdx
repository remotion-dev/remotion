    Cloud Run is in <a href="/docs/cloudrun-alpha">Alpha</a>, which means APIs may change in any version and documentation is not yet finished. See the <a href="https://remotion.dev/changelog">changelog to stay up to date with breaking changes</a>.

Takes a Remotion project, bundles it and uploads it to an Cloud Storage bucket. Once uploaded, a Cloud Run service can render any composition in the Remotion project by specifying the URL.

- If you make changes locally, you need to redeploy the site. You can use [`siteName`](#sitename) to overwrite the previous site.
- Note that the Remotion project will be deployed to a subdirectory, not the root of the domain. Therefore you must ensure that if you have specified paths in your Remotion project, they are able to handle this scenario.
- Before calling this function, you should create a bucket, see [`getOrCreateBucket()`](/docs/cloudrun/getorcreatebucket).

## Example

```ts twoslash
import {deploySite} from '@remotion/cloudrun';
import path from 'path';

const {serveUrl} = await deploySite({
  entryPoint: path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'src/index.ts'),
  bucketName: 'remotioncloudrun-c7fsl3d',
  options: {
    onBundleProgress: (progress) => {
      // Progress is between 0 and 100
      console.log(`Bundle progress: ${progress}%`);
    },
    onUploadProgress: ({totalFiles, filesUploaded, totalSize, sizeUploaded}) => {
      console.log(`Upload progress: Total files ${totalFiles}, Files uploaded ${filesUploaded}, Total size ${totalSize}, Size uploaded ${sizeUploaded}`);
    },
  },
});
console.log(serveUrl);
```

## Arguments

An object with the following properties:

### `entryPoint`

An absolute path pointing to the entry point of your Remotion project. [Usually the entry point in your Remotion project is stored at `src/entry.tsx`](/docs/terminology/entry-point).

### `bucketName`

The bucket to where the website will be deployed. The bucket must have been created by Remotion Cloud Run.

### `siteName?`

_optional_

Specify the subfolder in your Cloud Storage bucket that you want the site to deploy to. If you omit this property, a new subfolder with a random name will be created. If a site already exists with the name you passed, it will be overwritten. Can only contain the following characters: `0-9`, `a-z`, `A-Z`, `-`, `!`, `_`, `.`, `*`, `'`, `(`, `)`

### `options?`

_optional_

An object with the following properties:

#### `onBundleProgress`

Callback from Webpack when the bundling has progressed. Passes a number between 0 and 100 to the callback, see example at the top of the page.

#### `onUploadProgress`

Callback function that gets called when uploading of the assets has progressed. Passes an object with the following properties to the callback:

- `totalFiles` (_number_): Total number of files in the bundle.
- `filesUploaded` (_number_): Number of files that have been fully uploaded so far.
- `totalSize` (_number_): Total size in bytes of all the files in the bundle.
- `sizeUploaded` (_number_): Amount of bytes uploaded so far.

#### `webpackOverride`

Allows to pass a custom webpack override. See [`bundle()` -> webpackOverride](/docs/bundle#webpackoverride) for more information.

#### `enableCaching`

Whether webpack caching should be enabled. See [`bundle()` -> enableCaching](/docs/bundle#enablecaching) for more information.

#### `publicDir`

Set the directory in which the files that can be loaded using [`staticFile()`](/docs/staticfile) are located. By default it is the folder `public/` located in the [Remotion Root](/docs/terminology/remotion-root) folder. If you pass a relative path, it will be resolved against the [Remotion Root](/docs/terminology/remotion-root).

#### `rootDir`

The directory in which the Remotion project is rooted in. This should be set to the directory that contains the `package.json` which installs Remotion. By default, it is the current working directory.

:::note
The current working directory is the directory from which your program gets executed from. It is not the same as the file where bundle() gets called.
:::

#### `ignoreRegisterRootWarning`

Ignore an error that gets thrown if you pass an entry point file which does not contain `registerRoot`.

## Return value

An object with the following values:

### `serveUrl`

string\_

An URL such as `https://storage.googleapis.com/remotioncloudrun-123asd321/sites/abcdefgh/index.html`.

You can use this "Serve URL" to render a video on Remotion Cloud Run using:

- The [`npx remotion cloudrun render`](/docs/cloudrun/cli/render) command
- The [`renderMediaOnCloudrun()`](/docs/cloudrun/rendermediaoncloudrun) and [`renderStillOnCloudrun()`](/docs/cloudrun/renderstilloncloudrun) functions.
- Locally using the [`renderMedia()`](/docs/renderer/render-media) and [`renderStill()`](/docs/renderer/render-still) functions.
- Locally using the [`npx remotion render`](/docs/cli) and [`npx remotion still`](/docs/cli) commands

If you are rendering on Cloud Run, you can also pass the site name (in this case `abcdefgh`) as an abbreviation.

### `siteName`

_string_

The identifier of the site that was given. Is either the site name that you have passed into this function, or a random string that was generated if you didn't pass a site name.

### `stats`

An object with 3 entries:

- `uploadedFiles`
- `deletedFiles`
- `untouchedFiles`

Each one is a `number`.
