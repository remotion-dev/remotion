The `<Img>` tag can be used like a regular `<img>` HTML tag.

If you use `<Img>`, Remotion will ensure that the image is loaded before rendering the frame. That way you can avoid flickers if the image does not load immediately during rendering.

## API

### `src`

[Put an image into the `public/` folder](/docs/assets) and use [`staticFile()`](/docs/staticfile) to reference it.

```tsx twoslash
import {AbsoluteFill, Img, staticFile} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Img src={staticFile('hi.png')} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

You can also load a remote image:

```tsx twoslash
import {AbsoluteFill, Img} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Img src={'https://picsum.photos/200/300'} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

### `onError`

To use the `<Img>` tag in a resilient way, handle the error that occurs when an image can not be loaded:

```tsx twoslash
import {AbsoluteFill, Img, staticFile} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Img
        src={staticFile('hi.png')}
        onError={(event) => {
          // Handle image loading error here
        }}
      />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

If an error occurs, the component must be unmounted or the `src` must be replaced, otherwise the render will time out.

From `v3.3.82`, the image load will first be retried before `onError` is thrown.

### `maxRetries`<AvailableFrom v="3.3.82"/>

If an image fails to load, it will be retried from `v3.3.82`. The default value is `2`.  
An exponential backoff is being used, with 1000ms delay between the first and second attempt, then 2000ms, then 4000ms and so on.

### `pauseWhenLoading`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.111"/>

_optional_

If set to `true`, pause the Player when the image is loading. See: [Buffer state](/docs/player/buffer-state).

### `delayRenderTimeoutInMilliseconds`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.140" />

Customize the [timeout](/docs/delay-render#modifying-the-timeout) of the [`delayRender()`](/docs/delay-render) call that this component makes.

### `delayRenderRetries`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.140" />

Customize the [number of retries](/docs/delay-render#retrying) of the [`delayRender()`](/docs/delay-render) call that this component makes.  
Prefer the [`maxRetries`](#maxretries) prop over this.

### `errorBehavior`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.398" />

_optional_

Controls what happens when the image cannot be drawn to the canvas during [client-side rendering](/docs/client-side-rendering). This can happen when:

- The image fails to load (404, network error, invalid URL)
- The image is tainted due to CORS restrictions

**Values:**

- `"fail"` (default): The render will fail with an error message explaining the problem.
- `"ignore"`: The image will be skipped and nothing will be rendered in its place.

```tsx twoslash
import {AbsoluteFill, Img} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Img src="https://example.com/maybe-cors-enabled.png" errorBehavior="ignore" />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

This prop is primarily useful for client-side rendering where CORS restrictions are enforced. See [Migrating to client-side rendering](/docs/client-side-rendering/migration#ensure-assets-are-available-via-cors) for more information.

## Other props

Remotion inherits the props of the regular `<img>` tag, like for example `style`.

## GIFs

Don't use the `<Img>` tag for GIFs, use [`@remotion/gif`](/docs/gif) instead.

## Error behavior

From v4.0.0: If the image fails to load and no retries are left, then [`cancelRender`](/docs/cancel-render) will be called to throw an error, unless you handle the error using `onError()`.

From v3.3.82: If an image fails to load, it will be retried up to two times.

In earlier versions, failing to load an image would lead to an error message in the console and an eventual timeout.

## Restrictions

- The maximum resolution that Chrome can display is `2^29` pixels (539 megapixels) <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57223559/what-is-the-maximum-image-dimensions-supported-in-desktop-chrome#:~:text=than%202%5E29-,(539MP)">[source]</a></sup>. Remotion inherits this restriction.
