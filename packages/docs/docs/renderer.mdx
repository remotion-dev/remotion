The `@remotion/renderer` package provides APIs for rendering video server-side.
The package is also internally used by the Remotion CLI and [Remotion Lambda](/docs/lambda).

:::warning
The configuration file has no effect when using these APIs.

## Installation

## Server-side rendering examples

See the [Server-side rendering](/docs/ssr) for some examples of how to use server-side rendering.

## Available functions

The following APIs are available in the `@remotion/renderer` package:

<TableOfContents />

## What's the difference between `renderMedia()` and `renderFrames()`?

In Remotion 3.0, we added the [`renderMedia()`](/docs/renderer/render-media) API which combines `renderFrames()` and `stitchFramesToVideo()` into one simplified step and performs the render faster. Prefer `renderMedia()` if you can.
