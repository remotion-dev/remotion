Resolved in Remotion version v4.0.289.
:::

From Remotion version v4.0.274 - v4.0.288, there has been an inadvertent change that breaks some workflows on Lambda that expect Chrome to have been compiled proprietary video codecs.

## When you are affected

You are affected if you:

- are on Remotion version 4.0.274 - 4.0.288 (inclusive)
- are using Remotion Lambda
- are using the [getVideoMetadata()](/docs/get-video-metadata) API from [@remotion/media-utils](/docs/media-utils) or the `<Html5Video>` tag with an MP4 file

## Solution

Upgrade to Remotion version v4.0.289 or higher.

## Workarounds

- Option 1: Revert to Remotion version 4.0.273
- Option 2: Replace [getVideoMetadata()](/docs/renderer/get-video-metadata) with [parseMedia()](/docs/media-parser/parse-media) and `<Html5Video>` with `<OffthreadVideo>` if you can. We recommend both of these in general.

## Apologies

We are sorry for this oversight from our side and the troubles it may cause.

Weâ€™ll add tests to Remotion Lambda to ensure this issue cannot happen in the future.
