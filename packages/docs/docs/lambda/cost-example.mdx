title: How much does Remotion Lambda cost?
crumb: 'Lambda'
---

This page shows estimations to help you better expect how much Remotion Lambda will cost.  
All renders are done with the following Lambda configuration:

- 2048 MB RAM (default)
- 10GB Disk size (default from Remotion 5.0)
- Default [concurrency](/docs/lambda/concurrency)
- Warm Lambda functions (expect the first render to be more expensive)
- `us-east-1` region

Prices may also vary based on the region, heavyness of your bundle, fluctuations in latency.  
We always recommend to measure the cost of your composition yourself.

## Rendering the Hello World project

Rendering the [`HelloWorld`](https://github.com/remotion-dev/template-helloworld) composition of our default template.

**Cost**: $0.001

## Rendering a 1 minute Video in the same S3 bucket

```tsx twoslash title="OffthreadRemoteVideo.tsx"
import {CalculateMetadataFunction, OffthreadVideo, staticFile} from 'remotion';

export const calculateMetadataFn: CalculateMetadataFunction<{}> = async () => {
  return {
    durationInFrames: 60 * 30,
    fps: 30,
    width: 1280,
    height: 720,
  };
};

export const OffthreadRemoteVideo: React.FC = () => {
  return <OffthreadVideo src={staticFile('bigbuckbunny.mp4')} />;
};
```

[This](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/blob/main/packages/example/public/bigbuckbunny.mp4) is the video file used.

**Cost**: $0.021  
Rendering a video inside your video increases the cost significantly.

## Rendering a 10 minute Remote HD Video

```tsx twoslash title="OffthreadRemoteVideo.tsx"
import {CalculateMetadataFunction, OffthreadVideo} from 'remotion';

export const calculateMetadataFn: CalculateMetadataFunction<{}> = async () => {
  return {
    durationInFrames: 10 * 60 * 30,
    fps: 30,
    width: 1280,
    height: 720,
  };
};

export const OffthreadRemoteVideo: React.FC = () => {
  return <OffthreadVideo src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />;
};
```

**Cost**: $0.162

## Rendering a 10 second Remote 4K Video

```tsx twoslash title="OffthreadRemoteVideo.tsx"
import {CalculateMetadataFunction, OffthreadVideo} from 'remotion';

export const calculateMetadataFn: CalculateMetadataFunction<{}> = async () => {
  return {
    durationInFrames: 10 * 30,
    fps: 30,
    width: 3840,
    height: 2160,
  };
};

export const OffthreadRemoteVideo: React.FC = () => {
  return <OffthreadVideo src="https://videos.pexels.com/video-files/5530402/5530402-uhd_3840_2160_25fps.mp4" />;
};
```

**Cost**: $0.017  
Increasing the resolution to 4K does significantly increase the time to render and therfore the cost.

## Additional cost

The calculation above only factors in Lambda computation cost.  
This is usually the majority of the cost.  
However, you also incur additional cost for:

- [Bandwidth](/docs/lambda/data-transfer-cost): Pulling in assets happens always over HTTP and incurs S3 egress cost.
- Storage: Storing the sites and renders in S3 incurs S3 storage.
- CloudWatch Logs: Renders are logged to CloudWatch by default.
- [Remotion Licensing](https://remotion.pro/license): Teams of 4+ people also need to acquire a Remotion Company License in addition to the AWS cost.
