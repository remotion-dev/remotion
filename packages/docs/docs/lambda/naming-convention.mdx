A Remotion Lambda function has the following naming convention:

```
remotion-render-4-0-372-mem2048mb-disk2048mb-240sec
                ^^^^^^^    ^^^^       ^^^^   ^^^
                  |         |          |      |-- Timeout in seconds
                  |         |          |--------- Disk size in MB
                  |         |------------------- Memory size in MB
                  |----------------------------- Remotion version with dots replaced by dashes
```

When you deploy a function, the name is hardcoded. This has two functions:

- <Step>1</Step> Avoid having multiple functions with the same configuration unnecessarily.
- <Step>2</Step> Being able to guess the function name using
  <a href="/docs/lambda/speculatefunctionname">
    <code>speculateFunctionName()</code>
  </a>
  so you don't have to fetch a list of functions in your AWS account.
