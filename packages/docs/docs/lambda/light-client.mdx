The following methods and types can be imported from `@remotion/lambda/client`.

`@remotion/lambda/client` re-exports everything from the `@remotion/lambda-client` NPM package, which you can install if you only need these functions in your project, saving you some dependencies.

```tsx twoslash
// organize-imports-ignore
// ---cut---
import {
  renderMediaOnLambda,
  renderStillOnLambda,
  getRenderProgress,
  getCompositionsOnLambda,
  getFunctions,
  AwsRegion,
  RenderProgress,
  validateWebhookSignature,
  WebhookPayload,
  presignUrl,
  PresignUrlInput,
  getSites,
  speculateFunctionName,
  CustomCredentials, // available from v4.0.60
  getAwsClient, // available from v4.0.82
  deleteRender, // available from v4.0.84
  DeleteRenderInput, // available from v4.0.84
} from '@remotion/lambda/client';
```

:::info
`getServiceClient()` was included from v4.0.60 to v4.0.81 by mistake. Use [`getAwsClient()`](/docs/lambda/getawsclient) instead.
:::

These functions don't have any dependencies on our renderer and can be bundled for example with ESBuild or Webpack (like is the case for example in Next.js).

Importing the light client on edge frameworks (Vercel Edge, Cloudflare Workers) is currently not supported.

**We don't recommend calling these functions from the browser directly, as you will leak your AWS credentials.**

Instead, this light client is meant to reduce the bundle size and avoid problems if you are calling Remotion Lambda APIs from another Lambda function and therefore need to bundle your function code.

Commonly, Next.JS serverless endpoints or similar use AWS Lambda functions under the hood, for which `@remotion/lambda/client` can be used.
