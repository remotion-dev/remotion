## `--region`

The [AWS region](/docs/lambda/region-selection) to select. Both project and function should be in this region.

## `--yes`, `-y`

Removes a site without asking for confirmation.

```
npx remotion lambda sites rm abcdef -y
```

## `--force-bucket-name`<AvailableFrom v="3.3.42" />

Specify a specific bucket name to be used. [This is not recommended](/docs/lambda/multiple-buckets), instead let Remotion discover the right bucket automatically.

## `--force-path-style`<AvailableFrom v="4.0.202" />

Passes `forcePathStyle` to the AWS S3 client. If you don't know what this is, you probably don't need it.
