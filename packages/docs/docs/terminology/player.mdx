The Remotion Player is the React component [`<Player>`](/docs/player) that can be embedded into a React app.  
It can be used by installing the [`@remotion/player`](https://npmjs.org/packages/@remotion/player) package into a React app (for example: Create React App, Next.JS, Remix, React Router, Vite).  
It is not the same as the [Remotion Studio](/docs/terminology/studio).
