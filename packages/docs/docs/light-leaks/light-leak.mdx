# &lt;LightLeak&gt;<AvailableFrom v="4.0.415" />

Renders a WebGL-based light leak effect. The effect reveals during the first half of the duration and retracts during the second half.

## Example

<Demo type="light-leak" />

```tsx twoslash title="MyComp.tsx"
import {LightLeak} from '@remotion/light-leaks';
import {AbsoluteFill} from 'remotion';

const MyVideo = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill style={{backgroundColor: 'black'}}>
      <LightLeak durationInFrames={60} seed={3} hueShift={30} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

## API

Apart from the props listed below, all props from [`<Sequence>`](/docs/sequence) except `children` and `layout` are accepted.

### `seed?`

Determines the shape of the light leak pattern. Different seeds produce different patterns. Default: `0`.

### `hueShift?`

Rotates the hue of the light leak in degrees (`0`-`360`).

- `0` (default) yellow-to-orange
- `120` shifts toward green
- `240` shifts toward blue
