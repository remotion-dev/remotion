# &lt;LightLeak&gt;<AvailableFrom v="4.0.415" />

Renders a WebGL-based light leak effect.  
The effect reveals during the first half of the duration and retracts during the second half.  
Is a [`<Sequence>`](/docs/sequence) component under the hood and accepts it's props.

## Example

<Demo type="light-leak" />

```tsx twoslash title="MyComp.tsx"
import {LightLeak} from '@remotion/light-leaks';
import {AbsoluteFill} from 'remotion';

const MyVideo = () => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill style={{backgroundColor: 'black'}}>
      <LightLeak durationInFrames={60} seed={3} hueShift={30} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

## API

Apart from the props listed below, all props from [`<Sequence>`](/docs/sequence) except `children` and `layout` are accepted.

### `durationInFrames?`

The duration of the light leak effect in frames. The effect reveals during the first half and retracts during the second half.  
During the midpoint, the light leak will cover most of the canvas.

If not specified, defaults to the duration of the composition or sequence, reading from [`useVideoConfig()`](/docs/use-video-config).

### `seed?`

Determines the shape of the light leak pattern. Different seeds produce different patterns. Default: `0`.

### `hueShift?`

Rotates the hue of the light leak in degrees (`0`-`360`).

- `0` (default) yellow-to-orange
- `120` shifts toward green
- `240` shifts toward blue
