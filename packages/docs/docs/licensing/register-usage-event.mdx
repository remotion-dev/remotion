Registers a usage point for your Remotion license.  
Allows for accurate and up to date reporting and to track your usage on the Remotion dashboard.

```tsx twoslash title="Register a usage point"
import {registerUsageEvent} from '@remotion/licensing';

await registerUsageEvent({
  apiKey: 'rm_pub_xxxxx',
  event: 'cloud-render',
  host: 'https://myapp.com',
  succeeded: true,
});
```

## API

An object with the following properties:

### `licenseKey`

Type: `string`

Your Remotion public API key. You can get it from your Remotion.pro dashboard.

### `event`

Type: `string`

The event you want to register. This can be one of the following:

- `webcodec-conversion`
- `cloud-render`

### `host`

The domain at here you host your app.  
This should be the value of what `window.location.origin` evaluates to on your frontend.  
If the host is `localhost` or similar, it will be registered as non-billable.

### `succeeded`

Whether the event was successful or not.  
If the event was not successful, it will be registered as a non-billable event.

## Return value

A promise that resolves when the event was successfully registered.

The resolved object contains two properties:

### `billable`

Whether this was an event that should be billed.

### `classification`

Either, `"billable"`, `"development"` or `"failed"`.  
You do not have to pay for failed renders or renders doing development.
