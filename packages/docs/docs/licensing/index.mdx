_available from v4.0.237_

This package allows holders of the [Company License](https://remotion.pro/license) to send events to Remotion to track the usage of renders.  
Also, it offers an API to programmatically check the usage in order to implement spend controls.

### How do I use this package?

Not directly - you can directly pass the `licenseKey` option to track a render.

**For [`@remotion/lambda`](/docs/lambda)**: Pass the `licenseKey` option to [`renderMediaOnLambda()`](/docs/lambda/rendermediaonlambda#licensekey) and [`renderStillOnLambda()`](/docs/lambda/renderstillonlambda#licensekey) to trigger an event.  
**For [`@remotion/renderer`](/docs/renderer)**: Pass the `licenseKey` option to [`renderMedia()`](/docs/renderer/render-media#licensekey) and [`renderStill()`](/docs/renderer/render-still#licensekey) to trigger an event.  
**For [`@remotion/web-renderer`](/docs/client-side-rendering/telemetry)**: An event is always sent. You must pass a real `licenseKey` or declare your eligibility for the free license using `licenseKey: "free-license"` - see: [Telemetry in client-side rendering](/docs/client-side-rendering/telemetry#setting-a-license-key).  
**For [`@remotion/cloudrun`](/docs/cloudrun)** (_deprecated_): No telemetry is implemented. Use [`@remotion/licensing`](/docs/licensing) directly to track usage.  
**For [`@remotion/webcodecs`](/docs/webcodecs)** (_deprecated_): Telemetry has been removed in v4.0.399, as we have given up on monetizing this package.

On your company license dashboard on [remotion.pro](https://remotion.pro), you can find your license keys under the "Usage" tab.

### Do I need to use this package?

For all versions below Remotion 5.0, it is **voluntary** to use this package.  
An exception is [`@remotion/web-renderer`](/docs/client-side-rendering/telemetry), which will always send telemetry events.

If you are not eligible for the free license, you need to get a company license and are required to keep your seat count up to date to cover all your renders.

From Remotion 5.0, telemetry will be enabled for every render and it will be **mandatory** for customers to report renders using the `licenseKey` option.

### Can I use this package to count renders if I am eligible for the free license?

Yes, you may still create a project on [remotion.pro](https://remotion.pro) and use this package to count renders.  
You do not have to pay anything for the renders.  
This package is only used to count the number of renders, not for billing.

### Will I get charged based on the usage?

This package currently only counts renders, it does not bill you based on them.  
If you are a company license holder, you need to manually adjust your seat count on [remotion.pro](https://remotion.pro) to cover all your renders.

However, the plan is to introduce a system that automatically bills you based on the usage, eliminating the need for you to manually adjust the seat count.
