All animations in Remotion must be driven by the value returned by the [`useCurrentFrame()`](/docs/use-current-frame) hook. If you would like to use another way of animations in Remotion, you need an integration that supports synchronizing the timing with Remotion.

On this page, we maintain a list of integrations for popular ways of animating on the web, and provide status for popular requests.

## After Effects

See: [Lottie - Import from After Effects](/docs/after-effects)

## Anime.JS

See [this repository](https://github.com/remotion-dev/anime-example) for an example.

Read [this article](https://revidcraft.com/posts/remotion-part-02) how one developer integrated Anime.js with Remotion and boosted their efficiency.

## CSS animations

You can synchronize animations with Remotions time using the [`animation-play-state`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-play-state) and [`animation-delay`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-delay) CSS properties.

See an [example here](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/remotion-dev/css-animation-play-state).

## Framer Motion

At the moment, we don't have a Framer Motion integration, but are discussing the matter on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/issues/399).

## GIFs

Use the [`@remotion/gif`](/docs/gif) package.

## GreenSock

See: [How to integrate GreenSock with Remotion](https://archive.ph/dGQ19)

## Lottie

Use the [`@remotion/lottie`](/docs/lottie) package.

## Matter.js

There is no integration available, but there are two examples of how you can "bake" the Matter.js into a timeline in order to synchronize it later with Remotion:

- [Baking GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/remotion-dev/discussions/4373)
- [Pool game animation](https://github.com/hylarucoder/remotion-physics)

## React Native Skia

Use the [`@remotion/skia`](/docs/skia) package.

## react-spring

There is no direct compatibility but Remotion provides it's own [`spring()`](/docs/spring) instead.

## Reanimated

There is no integration available but Remotion shares some code with Reanimated, in particular [`interpolate()`](/docs/interpolate), [`spring()`](/docs/spring) and [`Easing`](/docs/easing). This makes it easier to refactor already existing animation from Reanimated.

## Rive

Use the [`@remotion/rive`](/docs/rive) package.

## TailwindCSS

See: [TailwindCSS](/docs/tailwind)

## Three.JS

Use the [`@remotion/three`](/docs/three) package.

## Vidstack

Use the [Remotion Provider for Vidstack](https://www.vidstack.io/docs/player/api/providers/remotion).

## Other libraries

Are you interested in using other libraries with Remotion? You can [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/issues/new) to inquire it. While we cannot guarantee to help, you can register interest and kick off the discussion.
