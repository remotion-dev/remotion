All captions must be processed in JSON. The captions must use the `Caption` type which is the following:

```ts
import type { Caption } from "@remotion/captions";
```

This is the definition:

```ts
type Caption = {
  text: string;
  startMs: number;
  endMs: number;
  timestampMs: number | null;
  confidence: number | null;
};
```
