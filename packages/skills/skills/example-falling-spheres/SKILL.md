## Falling Spheres Example

Glowing golden spheres with realistic bounce physics and 3D rendering.

See the full implementation in [assets/example.tsx](assets/example.tsx).

### Key Features

- ThreeCanvas setup with proper lighting
- Realistic gravity and bounce physics simulation
- Multiple spheres with staggered delays
- Squash/stretch deformation on impact
- Emissive glow effects on materials
- Ground plane with metallic material
