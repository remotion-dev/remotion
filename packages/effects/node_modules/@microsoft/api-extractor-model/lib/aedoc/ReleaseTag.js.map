They are applied to API items such\n * as classes, member functions, enums, etc.  The release tag applies recursively to members of a container\n * (e.g. class or interface). For example, if a class is marked as `@beta`, then all of its members automatically\n * have this status; you DON'T need add the `@beta` tag to each member function. However, you could add\n * `@internal` to a member function to give it a different release status.\n *\n * @public\n */\nexport enum ReleaseTag {\n  /**\n   * No release tag was specified in the AEDoc summary.\n   */\n  None = 0,\n  /**\n   * Indicates that an API item is meant only for usage by other NPM packages from the same\n   * maintainer.
