`void` in TypeScript refers to a function return that is meant to be ignored.
Attempting to use a `void`-typed value, such as storing the result of a called function in a variable, is often a sign of a programmer error.
`void` can also be misleading for other developers even if used correctly.

This rule prevents `void` type expressions from being used in misleading locations such as being assigned to a variable, provided as a function argument, or returned from a function.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
// somebody forgot that `alert` doesn't return anything
const response = alert('Are you sure?');
console.log(alert('Are you sure?'));

// it's not obvious whether the chained promise will contain the response (fixable)
promise.then(value => window.postMessage(value));

// it looks like we are returning the result of `console.error` (fixable)
function doSomething() {
  if (!somethingToDo) {
    return console.error('Nothing to do!');
  }

  console.log('Doing a thing...');
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="✅ Correct">

```ts
// just a regular void function in a statement position
alert('Hello, world!');

// this function returns a boolean value so it's ok
const response = confirm('Are you sure?');
console.log(confirm('Are you sure?'));

// now it's obvious that `postMessage` doesn't return any response
promise.then(value => {
  window.postMessage(value);
});

// now it's explicit that we want to log the error and return early
function doSomething() {
  if (!somethingToDo) {
    console.error('Nothing to do!');
    return;
  }

  console.log('Doing a thing...');
}

// using logical expressions for their side effects is fine
cond && console.log('true');
cond || console.error('false');
cond ? console.log('true') : console.error('false');
```

## Options

### `ignoreArrowShorthand`

{/* insert option description */}

Whether to ignore "shorthand" `() =>` arrow functions: those without `{ ... }` braces.

It might be undesirable to wrap every arrow function shorthand expression.
Especially when using the Prettier formatter, which spreads such code across 3 lines instead of 1.

Examples of additional **correct** code with this option enabled:

```ts option='{ "ignoreArrowShorthand": true }' showPlaygroundButton
promise.then(value => window.postMessage(value));
```

### `ignoreVoidOperator`

{/* insert option description */}

Whether to ignore returns that start with the `void` operator.

It might be preferable to only use some distinct syntax
to explicitly mark the confusing but valid usage of void expressions.
This option allows void expressions which are explicitly wrapped in the `void` operator.
This can help avoid confusion among other developers as long as they are made aware of this code style.

This option also changes the automatic fixes for common cases to use the `void` operator.
It also enables a suggestion fix to wrap the void expression with `void` operator for every problem reported.

Examples of additional **correct** code with this option enabled:

```ts option='{ "ignoreVoidOperator": true }' showPlaygroundButton
// now it's obvious that we don't expect any response
promise.then(value => void window.postMessage(value));

// now it's explicit that we don't want to return anything
function doSomething() {
  if (!somethingToDo) {
    return void console.error('Nothing to do!');
  }

  console.log('Doing a thing...');
}

// we are sure that we want to always log `undefined`
console.log(void alert('Hello, world!'));
```

### `ignoreVoidReturningFunctions`

{/* insert option description */}

Whether to ignore returns from functions with `void` return types when inside a function with a `void` return type.

Some projects prefer allowing functions that explicitly return `void` to return `void` expressions. Doing so allows more writing more succinct functions.

:::note
This is technically risky as the `void`-returning function might actually be returning a value not seen by the type system.
:::

```ts option='{ "ignoreVoidReturningFunctions": true }' showPlaygroundButton
function foo(): void {
  return console.log();
}

function onError(callback: () => void): void {
  callback();
}

onError(() => console.log('oops'));
```

## When Not To Use It

The return type of a function can be inspected by going to its definition or hovering over it in an IDE.
If you don't care about being explicit about the void type in actual code then don't use this rule.
Also, if you strongly prefer a concise coding style more strongly than any fear of `void`-related bugs then you can avoid this rule.
