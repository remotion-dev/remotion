`void` in TypeScript refers to a function return that is meant to be ignored.
The `void` operator is a useful tool to convey the programmer's intent to discard a value.
For example, it is recommended as one way of suppressing [`@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`](./no-floating-promises.mdx) instead of adding `.catch()` to a promise.

This rule helps an authors catch API changes where previously a value was being discarded at a call site, but the callee changed so it no longer returns a value.
When combined with [no-unused-expressions](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-unused-expressions), it also helps _readers_ of the code by ensuring consistency: a statement that looks like `void foo();` is **always** discarding a return value, and a statement that looks like `foo();` is **never** discarding a return value.
This rule reports on any `void` operator whose argument is already of type `void` or `undefined`.

## Examples

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
void (() => {})();

function foo() {}
void foo();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="✅ Correct">

```ts
(() => {})();

function foo() {}
foo(); // nothing to discard

function bar(x: number) {
  void x; // discarding a number
  return 2;
}
void bar(1); // discarding a number
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

### `checkNever`

## When Not To Use It

If you don't mind extra `void`s in your project, you can avoid this rule.
