 * Invoking the OS shell is not safe, not portable, and generally not recommended:

 * - Different shells have different behavior and command-line syntax, and which shell you

 *
 * - If a command parameter contains symbol characters, a shell may interpret them, which
 *   can introduce a security vulnerability
 *
 * - Each shell has different rules for escaping these symbols.  On Windows, the default
 *   shell is incapable of escaping certain character sequences.
 *
 * The Executable API provides a pure JavaScript implementation of primitive shell-like
 * functionality for searching the default PATH, appending default file extensions on Windows,
 * and executing a file that may contain a POSIX shebang.  This primitive functionality
 * is sufficient (and recommended) for most tooling scenarios.
 *
 * If you need additional shell features such as wildcard globbing, environment variable
 * expansion, piping, or built-in commands, then we recommend to use the `@microsoft/rushell`

     * Provides a way to improve process startup times by lazy-loading imported modules.
     *
     * @remarks
     * This is a more structured wrapper for the {@link https://www.npmjs.com/package/import-lazy|import-lazy}
     * package.  It enables you to replace an import like this:
     *
     * ```ts
     * import * as example from 'example'; // <-- 100ms load time
     *
     * if (condition) {
     *   example.doSomething();
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ...with a pattern like this:
     *
     * ```ts
     * const example: typeof import('example') = Import.lazy('example', require);
     *
     * if (condition) {
     *   example.doSomething(); // <-- 100ms load time occurs here, only if needed
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * The implementation relies on JavaScript's `Proxy` feature to intercept access to object members.  Thus
     * it will only work correctly with certain types of module exports.  If a particular export isn't well behaved,
     * you may need to find (or introduce) some other module in your dependency graph to apply the optimization to.
     *
     * Usage guidelines:
     *
     * - Always specify types using `typeof` as shown above.
     *
     * - Never apply lazy-loading in a way that would convert the module's type to `any`. Losing type safety
     *   seriously impacts the maintainability of the code base.
     *
     * - In cases where the non-runtime types are needed, import them separately using the `Types` suffix:
     *
     * ```ts
     * const example: typeof import('example') = Import.lazy('example', require);
     * import type * as exampleTypes from 'example';
     * ```
     *
     * - If the imported module confusingly has the same name as its export, then use the Module suffix:
     *
     * ```ts
     * const exampleModule: typeof import('../../logic/Example') = Import.lazy(
     *   '../../logic/Example', require);
     * import type * as exampleTypes from '../../logic/Example';
     * ```
     *
     * - If the exports cause a lot of awkwardness (e.g. too many expressions need to have `exampleModule.` inserted
     *   into them), or if some exports cannot be proxied (e.g. `Import.lazy('example', require)` returns a function
     *   signature), then do not lazy-load that module.  Instead, apply lazy-loading to some other module which is
     *   better behaved.
     *
     * - It's recommended to sort imports in a standard ordering:
     *
     * ```ts
     * // 1. external imports
     * import * as path from 'path';
     * import { Import, JsonFile, JsonObject } from '@rushstack/node-core-library';
     *
     * // 2. local imports
     * import { LocalFile } from './path/LocalFile';
     *
     * // 3. lazy-imports (which are technically variables, not imports)
     * const semver: typeof import('semver') = Import.lazy('semver', require);
     * ```

 *
 * @remarks

 * the entire string each time a chunk is appended, resulting in `O(n^2)` bytes of memory being allocated
 * (and later freed by the garbage  collector), and many of the allocations could be very large objects.
 * StringBuilder avoids this overhead by accumulating the chunks in an array, and efficiently joining them
 * when `getText()` is finally called.

/**
 * Provides a version-independent implementation of the JavaScript `instanceof` operator.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The JavaScript `instanceof` operator normally only identifies objects from a particular library instance.
 * For example, suppose the NPM package `example-lib` has two published versions 1.2.0 and 1.3.0, and
 * it exports a class called `A`.  Suppose some code consumes version `1.3.0` of the library, but it receives
 * an object that was constructed using version `1.2.0`.  In this situation `a instanceof A` will return `false`,
 * even though `a` is an instance of `A`.  The reason is that there are two prototypes for `A`; one for each
 * version.
 *
 * The `TypeUuid` facility provides a way to make `a instanceof A` return true for both prototypes of `A`,
 * by instead using a universally unique identifier (UUID) to detect object instances.
 *
 * You can use `Symbol.hasInstance` to enable the system `instanceof` operator to recognize type UUID equivalence:
 * ```ts
 * const uuidWidget: string = '9c340ef0-d29f-4e2e-a09f-42bacc59024b';
 * class Widget {
 *   public static [Symbol.hasInstance](instance: object): boolean {
 *     return TypeUuid.isInstanceOf(instance, uuidWidget);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * // Example usage:
 * ```ts
 * import { Widget as Widget1 } from 'v1-of-library';
 * import { Widget as Widget2 } from 'v2-of-library';
 * const widget = new Widget2();
 * console.log(widget instanceof Widget1); // prints true
 * ```
 *
